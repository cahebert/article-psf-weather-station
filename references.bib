	abstract = {This work and its companion paper, Amon et al. (2021), present cosmic shear measurements and cosmological constraints from over 100 million source galaxies in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data. We constrain the lensing amplitude parameter \$S\_8{\textbackslash}equiv{\textbackslash}sigma\_8{\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{m\}/0.3\}\$ at the 3\% level in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM: \$S\_8=0.759{\textasciicircum}\{+0.025\}\_\{-0.023\}\$ (68\% CL). Our constraint is at the 2\% level when using angular scale cuts that are optimized for the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM analysis: \$S\_8=0.772{\textasciicircum}\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.017\}\$ (68\% CL). With cosmic shear alone, we find no statistically significant constraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at our present statistical power. We carry out our analysis blind, and compare our measurement with constraints from two other contemporary weak-lensing experiments: the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) and Hyper-Suprime Camera Subaru Strategic Program (HSC). We additionally quantify the agreement between our data and external constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Our DES Y3 result under the assumption of \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM is found to be in statistical agreement with Planck 2018, although favors a lower \$S\_8\$ than the CMB-inferred value by \$2.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ (a \$p\$-value of 0.02). This paper explores the robustness of these cosmic shear results to modeling of intrinsic alignments, the matter power spectrum and baryonic physics. We additionally explore the statistical preference of our data for intrinsic alignment models of different complexity. The fiducial cosmic shear model is tested using synthetic data, and we report no biases greater than 0.3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ in the plane of \$S\_8{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{m\}\$ caused by uncertainties in the theoretical models.},

	abstract = {We measure weak lensing cosmic shear power spectra from the three-year galaxy shear catalog of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program imaging survey. The shear catalog covers \$416 {\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{deg\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ of the northern sky, with a mean \$i\$-band seeing of 0.59 arcsec and an effective galaxy number density of 15 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{arcmin\}{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ within our adopted redshift range. With an \$i\$-band magnitude limit of 24.5 mag, and four tomographic redshift bins spanning \$0.3 {\textbackslash}leq z\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ph\}\} {\textbackslash}leq 1.5\$ based on photometric redshifts, we obtain a high-significance measurement of the cosmic shear power spectra, with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 26.4 in the multipole range \$300{\textless}{\textbackslash}ell{\textless}1800\$. The accuracy of our power spectrum measurement is tested against realistic mock shear catalogs, and we use these catalogs to get a reliable measurement of the covariance of the power spectrum measurements. We use a robust blinding procedure to avoid confirmation bias, and model various uncertainties and sources of bias in our analysis, including point spread function systematics, redshift distribution uncertainties, the intrinsic alignment of galaxies and the modeling of the matter power spectrum. For a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model, we find \$S\_8 {\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 ({\textbackslash}Omega\_m/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\} =0.776{\textasciicircum}\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.033\}\$, which is in excellent agreement with the constraints from the other HSC Year 3 cosmology analyses, as well as those from a number of other cosmic shear experiments. This result implies a \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$2{\textbackslash}sigma\$-level tension with the Planck 2018 cosmology. We study the effect that various systematic errors and modeling choices could have on this value, and find that they can shift the best-fit value of \$S\_8\$ by no more than \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$0.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$, indicating that our result is robust to such systematics.},

As our formula requires the three-point shear correlation function, we also present an efﬁcient tree-based algorithm for measuring it. We show how our algorithm would scale in computing time and memory usage for future lensing surveys. We also apply the procedure to our CTIO survey data, originally described in Jarvis et al. (2003).

	abstract = {Cosmological weak lensing measurements rely on a precise measurement of the shear two-point correlation function (2PCF) along with a deep understanding of systematics that aﬀect it. In this work, we demonstrate a general framework for describing the impact of PSF systematics on the cosmic shear 2PCF, and mitigating its impact on cosmological analysis. Our framework can describe leakage and modeling error from all spin-2 quantities contributed by the PSF second and higher moments, rather than just the second moments. We interpret null tests using the HSC Year 3 (Y3) catalogs with this formalism, and ﬁnd that leakage from the spin-2 combination of PSF fourth moments is the leading contributor to additive shear systematics, with total contamination that is an order of magnitude higher than that contributed by PSF second moments alone. We conducted a mock cosmic shear analysis for HSC Y3, and ﬁnd that, if uncorrected, PSF systematics can bias the cosmological parameters Ωm and S8 by ∼0.3σ. The traditional second moment-based model can only correct for a 0.1σ bias, leaving the contamination largely uncorrected. We conclude it is necessary to model both PSF second and fourth moment contamination for HSC Y3 cosmic shear analysis. We also reanalyze the HSC Y1 cosmic shear analysis with our updated systematics model, and identify a 0.07σ bias on Ωm when using the more restricted second moment model from the original analysis. We demonstrate how to self-consistently use the method in both real space and Fourier space, assess shear systematics in tomographic bins, and test for PSF model overﬁtting.},

            Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful tools for cosmology, while subject to challenges in quantifying subtle systematic biases. The point spread function (PSF) can cause biases in weak lensing shear inference when the PSF model does not match the true PSF that is convolved with the galaxy light profile. Although the effect of PSF size and shape errors – i.e. errors in second moments – is well studied, weak lensing systematics associated with errors in higher moments of the PSF model require further investigation. The goal of our study is to estimate their potential impact for LSST weak lensing analysis. We go beyond second moments of the PSF by using image simulations to relate multiplicative bias in shear to errors in the higher moments of the PSF model. We find that the current level of errors in higher moments of the PSF model in data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey can induce a ∼0.05 per cent shear bias, making this effect unimportant for ongoing surveys but relevant at the precision of upcoming surveys such as LSST.},

            Weak lensing is one of the most powerful probes for dark matter and dark energy science, although it faces increasing challenges in controlling systematic uncertainties as the statistical errors become smaller. The point spread function (PSF) needs to be precisely modeled to avoid systematic error on the weak lensing measurements. The weak lensing biases induced by errors in the PSF model second moments, i.e. its size and shape, are well-studied. However, Zhang et al. showed that errors in the higher moments of the PSF may also be a significant source of systematics for upcoming weak lensing surveys. Therefore, this work comprehensively investigate the modelling quality of PSF moments from the 3rd to 6th order, and propagate the PSFEx higher moments modelling error in the HSC survey data set to the weak lensing shear–shear correlation functions and their cosmological analyses. The overall multiplicative shear bias associated with errors in PSF higher moments can cause an ∼0.1σ shift on the cosmological parameters for LSST Y10, while the associated additive biases can induce 1σ uncertainties in cosmology parameter inference for LSST Y10, if not accounted. We compare the PSFEx model with PSF in Full FOV, and find similar performance in modelling the PSF higher moments. We conclude that PSF higher moment errors of the future PSF models should be reduced from those in current methods, otherwise needed to be explicitly modeled in the weak lensing analysis.},

	abstract = {We use SDSS imaging data in \$ugriz\$ passbands to study the shape of the point spread function (PSF) profile and the variation of its width with wavelength and time. We find that the PSF profile is well described by theoretical predictions based on von K{\textbackslash}'\{a\}rm{\textbackslash}'\{a\}n's turbulence theory. The observed PSF radial profile can be parametrized by only two parameters, the profile's full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a normalization of the contribution of an empirically determined "instrumental" PSF. The profile shape is very similar to the "double gaussian plus power-law wing" decomposition used by SDSS image processing pipeline, but here it is successfully modeled with two free model parameters, rather than six as in SDSS pipeline. The FWHM variation with wavelength follows the \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ power law, where \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}approx-0.3\$ and is correlated with the FWHM itself. The observed behavior is much better described by von K{\textbackslash}'\{a\}rm{\textbackslash}'\{a\}n's turbulence theory with the outer scale parameter in the range 5\$-\$100 m, than by the Kolmogorov's turbulence theory. We also measure the temporal and angular structure functions for FWHM and compare them to simulations and results from literature. The angular structure function saturates at scales beyond 0.5\$-\$1.0 degree. The power spectrum of the temporal behavior is found to be broadly consistent with a damped random walk model with characteristic timescale in the range \${\textbackslash}sim5-30\$ minutes, though data show a shallower high-frequency behavior. The latter is well fit by a single power law with index in the range \$-1.5\$ to \$-1.0\$. A hybrid model is likely needed to fully capture both the low-frequency and high-frequency behavior of the temporal variations of atmospheric seeing.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the ﬁnal full-mission Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies, combining information from the temperature and polarization maps and the lensing reconstruction. Compared to the 2015 results, improved measurements of large-scale polarization allow the reionization optical depth to be measured with higher precision, leading to signiﬁcant gains in the precision of other correlated parameters. Improved modelling of the small-scale polarization leads to more robust constraints on many parameters, with residual modelling uncertainties estimated to aﬀect them only at the 0.5 σ level. We ﬁnd good consistency with the standard spatially-ﬂat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base ΛCDM” in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density Ωch2 = 0.120 ± 0.001, baryon density Ωbh2 = 0.0224 ± 0.0001, scalar spectral index ns = 0.965 ± 0.004, and optical depth τ = 0.054 ± 0.007 (in this abstract we quote 68 \% conﬁdence regions on measured parameters and 95 \% on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to 0.03 \% precision, with 100θ∗ = 1.0411 ± 0.0003. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-ΛCDM cosmology, the inferred (model-dependent) late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant H0 = (67.4±0.5) km s−1Mpc−1; matter density parameter Ωm = 0.315±0.007; and matter ﬂuctuation amplitude σ8 = 0.811±0.006. We ﬁnd no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-ΛCDM model. Combining with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements (and considering single-parameter extensions) we constrain the eﬀective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be Neﬀ = 2.99 ± 0.17, in agreement with the Standard Model prediction Neﬀ = 3.046, and ﬁnd that the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to mν {\textless} 0.12 eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base ΛCDM at over 2 σ, which pulls some parameters that aﬀect the lensing amplitude away from the ΛCDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data. The joint constraint with BAO measurements on spatial curvature is consistent with a ﬂat universe, ΩK = 0.001±0.002. Also combining with Type Ia supernovae (SNe), the dark-energy equation of state parameter is measured to be w0 = −1.03 ± 0.03, consistent with a cosmological constant. We ﬁnd no evidence for deviations from a purely power-law primordial spectrum, and combining with data from BAO, BICEP2, and Keck Array data, we place a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r0.002 {\textless} 0.06. Standard big-bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the base-ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. The Planck base-ΛCDM results are in good agreement with BAO, SNe, and some galaxy lensing observations, but in slight tension with the Dark Energy Survey’s combined-probe results including galaxy clustering (which prefers lower ﬂuctuation amplitudes or matter density parameters), and in signiﬁcant, 3.6 σ, tension with local measurements of the Hubble constant (which prefer a higher value). Simple model extensions that can partially resolve these tensions are not favoured by the Planck data.},

            We present the galaxy shear catalog that will be used for the three-year cosmological weak gravitational lensing analyses using data from the Wide layer of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (SSP) Survey. The galaxy shapes are measured from the i-band imaging data acquired from 2014 to 2019 and calibrated with image simulations that resemble the observing conditions of the survey based on training galaxy images from the Hubble Space Telescope in the COSMOS region. The catalog covers an area of 433.48 deg2 of the northern sky, split into six fields. The mean i-band seeing is \$\{0\{{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime {\textbackslash}prime\}\_\{.\}\}59\}\$. With conservative galaxy selection criteria (e.g., i-band magnitude brighter than 24.5), the observed raw galaxy number density is 22.9 arcmin−2, and the effective galaxy number density is 19.9 arcmin−2. The calibration removes the galaxy property-dependent shear estimation bias to the level {\textbar}δm{\textbar} \&lt; 9 × 10−3. The bias residual δm shows no dependence on redshift in the range 0 \&lt; z ≤ 3. We define the requirements for cosmological weak-lensing science for this shear catalog, and quantify potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for systematics related to point-spread function modelling and shear estimation. A variety of the null tests are statistically consistent with zero or within requirements, but (i) there is evidence for PSF model shape residual correlations; and (ii) star–galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics. Both effects become significant on \&gt;1° scales and will require mitigation during the inference of cosmological parameters using cosmic shear measurements.},

	abstract = {The accurate modelling of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is of paramount importance in astronomical observations, as it allows for the correction of distortions and blurring caused by the telescope and atmosphere. PSF modelling is crucial for accurately measuring celestial objects’ properties. The last decades brought us a steady increase in the power and complexity of astronomical telescopes and instruments. Upcoming galaxy surveys like Euclid and LSST will observe an unprecedented amount and quality of data. Modelling the PSF for these new facilities and surveys requires novel modelling techniques that can cope with the ever-tightening error requirements. The purpose of this review is three-fold. First, we introduce the optical background required for a more physically-motivated PSF modelling and propose an observational model that can be reused for future developments. Second, we provide an overview of the different physical contributors of the PSF, including the optic- and detector-level contributors and the atmosphere. We expect that the overview will help better understand the modelled effects. Third, we discuss the different methods for PSF modelling from the parametric and non-parametric families for ground- and space-based telescopes, with their advantages and limitations. Validation methods for PSF models are then addressed, with several metrics related to weak lensing studies discussed in detail. Finally, we explore current challenges and future directions in PSF modelling for astronomical telescopes.},

The characteristics of these results were compared to the results obtained from simulated atmospheric turbulence produced by a Kolmogorov atmosphere simulation. A low-frequency variation in the Zernike coeﬃcient time series is observed in the pseudo open-loop phase maps reconstructed from the GPI data, that is not present in the simulation.

	abstract = {The direct detection of photons emitted or reﬂected by extrasolar planets, spatially resolved from their parent star, is a major frontier in the study of other solar systems. Direct detection will provide statistical information on planets in 5–50 AU orbits, inaccessible to current Doppler searches, and allow spectral characterization of radius, temperature, surface gravity, and perhaps composition. Achieving this will require new, dedicated, high-contrast instruments. One such system under construction is the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). This combines a high-order/high-speed adaptive optics system to control wavefront errors from the Earth’s atmosphere, an advanced coronagraph to block diffraction, ultrasmooth optics, a precision infrared interferometer to measure and correct systematic errors, and a integral ﬁeld spectrograph/polarimeter to image and characterize target planetary systems. We predict that GPI will be able to detect planets with brightness less than 10−7 of their parent star, sufﬁcient to observe warm self-luminous planets around a large population of targets.

They were built to primarily perform speckle interferometry providing diffraction-limited imagery at optical wavebands, yielding pixel scale uncertainties of ±0.21 mas, position angle uncertainties of ±0.7◦, and photometric uncertainties of Δm ± 0.02–0.04 magnitudes (for the blue and red channels, respectively) when run through the standard data reduction pipeline. One of their main scientiﬁc roles is the validation and characterization of exoplanets and their host stars as discovered by transit surveys such as the NASA Kepler, K2, and TESS missions. The limiting magnitude for speckle observations at Gemini can be quite faint (r ∼18 in good observing conditions) but typically the observed targets are brighter. The instruments can also function as conventional CCD imagers providing a 1 arc-minute ﬁeld of view and allowing simultaneous two-color, high-speed time-series operation.

Using a wide binary star (35″ separation) and analyzing the spatiotemporal cross-correlation images, we achieve a C2N profile with a vertical resolution of a few tens of meters. We present the principle and the data-reduction process of this method and show first results obtained with a SCIDAR instrument mounted to the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) on the top of Mount Graham. As an application, we estimate the fraction of the turbulence between the dome of the VATT and the primary mirror of the Large Binocular Telescope.},

	abstract = {We present a Python package, pwv\_kpno, which provides models for the atmospheric transmission due to precipitable water vapor (PWV) at user-speciﬁed sites. Using the package, ground-based photometric observations taken between 3000 and 12,000 Å can be corrected for atmospheric effects due to PWV. Atmospheric transmission in the optical and near-infrared is highly dependent on the PWV column density along the line of sight. By measuring the delay of dual-band GPS signals through the atmosphere, the SuomiNet project provides accurate PWV measurements for hundreds of locations around the world. The pwv\_kpnopackage uses published SuomiNet data in conjunction with MODTRAN models to determine the modeled, time-dependent atmospheric transmission. A dual-band GPS system was installed at Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) in the spring of 2015. Using measurements from this receiver we demonstrate that we can successfully predict the PWV at KPNO from nearby dual-band GPS stations on the surrounding desert ﬂoor. The pwv\_kpnopackage can thus provide atmospheric transmission functions for observations taken before the KPNO receiver was installed. Using PWV measurements from the desert ﬂoor, we correctly model PWV absorption features present in spectra taken at KPNO. We also demonstrate how to conﬁgure the package for use at other observatories.},

This distortion ﬁeld is measurable at the locations of stars with accurate positions provided by the Gaia DR2 catalog; we develop the use of Gaussian process regression (GPR) to interpolate the distortion ﬁeld to arbitrary locations in each exposure. We introduce an extension to standard GPR techniques that exploits the knowledge that the 2-dimensional distortion ﬁeld is curl-free. Applied to several hundred 90-second exposures from the Dark Energy Survey as a testbed, we ﬁnd that the GPR correction reduces the variance of the turbulent distortions ≈ 12×, on average, with better performance in denser regions of the Gaia catalog. The RMS percoordinate distortion in the riz bands is typically ≈ 7 mas before any correction, and ≈ 2 mas after application of the GPR model. The GPR astrometric corrections are validated by the observation that their use reduces, from 10 to 5 mas RMS, the residuals to an orbit ﬁt to riz-band observations over 5 years of the r = 18.5 trans-Neptunian object Eris. We also propose a GPR method, not yet implemented, for simultaneously estimating the turbulence ﬁelds and the 5-dimensional stellar solutions in a stack of overlapping exposures, which should yield further turbulence reductions in future deep surveys.},

The seeing and effective wavefront velocity are measured as well. GSM does not suffer from dome and mirror seeing effects and can be used anywhere for site evaluation.},

For the ﬁrst time, the contribution to the optical turbulence of the radiation of the ground was studied. Quantitative estimations are given of the ability of the model to simulate the temperature near the ground around the telescope. Moreover, a set of 3D simulations shows that the horizontal distribution of the optical turbulence is not necessarily uniform, especially in the ﬁrst 10 km above the ground.

Such overall calibration biases cannot be detected by the standard tests such as E/B decomposition or calibration with stars. We ﬁnd that the non-Gaussianity of point spread function has a signiﬁcant eﬀect and can lead to up to 15 per cent error on the linear amplitude of ﬂuctuations σ8 depending on the method of analysis. This could explain some of the discrepancies seen in recent amplitude determinations from weak lensing. Using an elliptical Laguerre expansion method we develop a re-Gaussianization method which reduces the error to calibration error of order 1 per cent even for poorly resolved galaxies. We also discuss a new type of shear selection bias which results in up to roughly 8 percent underestimation of the signal. It is expected to scale with redshift, inducing errors in the growth factor extraction if not properly corrected for. Understanding and correcting for such eﬀects is crucial if weak lensing is to become a high precision probe of cosmology.},

We present a statistically principled, general solution to this problem. Our technique infers multiplicative shear calibration parameters by modifying the actual survey data to simulate the effects of a known shear. It can be applied to any shear estimation method based on weighted averages of galaxy shape measurements, which includes all methods used to date for shear estimation with real data. Use of the real images mitigates uncertainty due to unknown galaxy morphology, which is a serious concern for calibration of shear estimates based on image simulations. We test our results on simulated images from the GREAT3 challenge, and show that the method eliminates calibration biases for several different shape measurement techniques at the level of precision measurable with the GREAT3 simulations (a few tenths of a percent).},

After conservative masking and galaxy selection, the survey covers 416 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ of the northern sky with an effective galaxy number density of 15 arcmin\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ over the four redshift bins. The 2PCFs adopted for cosmology analysis are measured in the angular range: \$7.1 {\textless} {\textbackslash}theta/\{{\textbackslash}rm arcmin\} {\textless} 56.6\$ for \${\textbackslash}xi\_+\$ and \$31.2 {\textless}{\textbackslash}theta/\{{\textbackslash}rm arcmin\} {\textless} 248\$ for \${\textbackslash}xi\_-\$, with a total signal-to-noise ratio of 26.6. We apply a conservative, wide, flat prior on the photometric redshift errors on the last two tomographic bins, and the relative magnitudes of the cosmic shear amplitude across four redshift bins allow us to calibrate the photometric redshift errors. With this flat prior on redshift errors, we find \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}=0.256\_\{-0.044\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.056\}\$ and \$S\_8{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 {\textbackslash}sqrt\{{\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3\}=0.769\_\{-0.034\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.031\}\$ (both 68{\textbackslash}\% CI) for a flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$ cold dark matter cosmology. We find, after unblinding, that our constraint on \$S\_8\$ is consistent with the Fourier space cosmic shear and the 3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt analyses on the same HSC dataset. We carefully study the potential systematics from astrophysical and systematic model uncertainties in our fiducial analysis using synthetic data, and report no biases (including projection bias in the posterior space) greater than \$0.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ in the estimation of \$S\_8\$. Our analysis hints that the mean redshifts of the two highest tomographic bins are higher than initially estimated. In addition, a number of consistency tests are conducted to assess the robustness of our analysis.

Through a series of two-point null-tests, we validate the shear estimates, ﬁnding no evidence for signiﬁcant non-lensing B-mode distortions in the data. The PSF residuals are detected in the highest-redshift bins, originating from object selection and/or weight bias. The amplitude is, however, shown to be sufﬁciently low and within our stringent requirements. With a shear-ratio null-test, we verify the expected redshift scaling of the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal around luminous red galaxies. We conclude that the joint KiDS-1000 shear and photometric redshift calibration is sufﬁciently robust for combined-probe gravitational lensing and spectroscopic clustering analyses.},

	abstract = {Methods. We use ray-tracing through the Millennium Simulation, a large N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation, to calculate various cosmic-shear and galaxy-galaxy-lensing statistics. We compare the results from ray-tracing to semi-analytic predictions.
Results. (i) We conﬁrm that the ﬁrst-order approximation (i.e. neglecting lensing eﬀects beyond ﬁrst order in density ﬂuctuations) provides an excellent ﬁt to cosmic-shear power spectra as long as the actual matter power spectrum is used as input. Common ﬁtting formulae, however, strongly underestimate the cosmic-shear power spectra (by {\textgreater}30\% on scales {\textgreater} 10 000). Halo models provide a better ﬁt to cosmic shear-power spectra, but there are still noticeable deviations (∼10\%). (ii) Cosmic-shear B-modes, which are induced by Born corrections and lens-lens coupling, are at least three orders of magnitude smaller than cosmic-shear E-modes. Semianalytic extensions to the ﬁrst-order approximation predict the right order of magnitude for the B-mode. Compared to the ray-tracing results, however, the semi-analytic predictions may diﬀer by a factor two on small scales and also show a diﬀerent scale dependence. (iii) The ﬁrst-order approximation may under- or overestimate the galaxy-galaxy-lensing shear signal by several percent due to the neglect of magniﬁcation bias, which may lead to a correlation between the shear and the observed number density of lenses.
Conclusions. (i) Current semi-analytic models need to be improved in order to match the degree of statistical accuracy expected for future weak-lensing surveys. (ii) Shear B-modes induced by corrections to the ﬁrst-order approximation are not important for future cosmic-shear surveys. (iii) Magniﬁcation bias can be important for galaxy-galaxy-lensing surveys.},

This is true at order O(Φ2) in the gravitational potential. We extend the standard calculation, constructing all corrections to order O(Φ4). There are four types of corrections: corrections to the lensing shear due to multipledeﬂections; corrections due to the fact that shape distortions probe the reduced shear γ/(1 − κ) rather than the shear itself; corrections associated with the non-linear conversion of reduced shear to mean ellipticity; and corrections due to the fact that observational galaxy selection and shear measurement is based on galaxy brightnesses and sizes which have been (de)magniﬁed by lensing. We show how the previously considered corrections to the shear power spectrum correspond to terms in our analysis, and highlight new terms that were not previously identiﬁed. All correction terms are given explicitly as integrals over the matter power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum, and are numerically evaluated for the case of sources at z = 1. We ﬁnd agreement with previous works for the O(Φ3) terms. We ﬁnd that for ambitious future surveys, the O(Φ4) terms aﬀect the power spectrum at the ∼ 1 − 5σ level; they will thus need to be accounted for, but are unlikely to represent a serious diﬃculty for weak lensing as a cosmological probe.},

	abstract = {One probe for systematic eﬀects in gravitational lensing surveys is the presence of so-called B modes in the cosmic shear two-point correlation functions, ξ±(ϑ), since lensing is expected to produce only E-mode shear. Furthermore, there exist ambiguous modes that cannot uniquely be assigned to either E- or B-mode shear. In this paper we derive explicit equations for the pure-mode shear correlation functions, ξ±E/B(ϑ), and their ambiguous components, ξ±amb(ϑ), that can be derived from the measured ξ±(ϑ) on a ﬁnite angular interval, ϑmin ≤ ϑ ≤ ϑmax, such that ξ±(ϑ) can be decomposed uniquely into pure-mode functions as ξ+ = ξ+E + ξ+B + ξ+amb and ξ− = ξ−E − ξ−B + ξ−amb. The derivation is obtained by deﬁning a new set of Complete Orthogonal Sets of E and B mode-separating Integrals (COSEBIs), for which explicit relations are obtained and which yields a smaller covariance between COSEBI modes. We derive the relation between ξ±E/B/amb and the underlying E- and B-mode power spectra. The pure-mode correlation functions can provide a diagnostic of systematics in conﬁguration space. We then apply our results to Scinet LIght Cone Simulations (SLICS) and the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) cosmic shear data, calculate the new COSEBIs and the pure-mode correlation functions, as well as the corresponding covariances, and show that the new statistics ﬁt equally well to the best ﬁtting cosmological model as the previous KiDS-1000 analysis and recover the same level of (insigniﬁcant) B modes. We also consider in some detail the ambiguous modes at the ﬁrst- and second-order level, ﬁnding some surprising results. For example, the shear ﬁeld of a point mass, when cut along a line through the center, cannot be ascribed uniquely to an E-mode shear and is thus ambiguous; additionally, the shear correlation functions resulting from a random ensemble of point masses, when measured over a ﬁnite angular range, correspond to an ambiguous mode.},

For DESSV we detect B-modes at the level of 2.8σ in a non-tomographic analysis, increasing to a 5.5σ B-mode detection in a tomographic analysis. In order to understand the origin of these detected B-modes we measure the B-mode signature of a range of diﬀerent simulated systematics including PSF leakage, random but correlated PSF modelling errors, camera-based additive shear bias and photometric redshift selection bias. We show that any correlation between photometric-noise and the relative orientation of the galaxy to the point-spread-function leads to an ellipticity selection bias in tomographic analyses. This work therefore introduces a new systematic for future lensing surveys to consider. We ﬁnd that the B-modes in DES-SV appear similar to a superposition of the Bmode signatures from all of the systematics simulated.

	abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is the most surprising cosmological discovery in many decades, implying that the universe is dominated by some form of “dark energy” with exotic physical properties, or that Einstein’s theory of gravity breaks down on cosmological scales. The profound implications of cosmic acceleration have inspired ambitious eﬀorts to understand its origin, with experiments that aim to measure the history of expansion and growth of structure with percent-level precision or higher. We review in detail the four most well established methods for making such measurements: Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), weak gravitational lensing, and the abundance of galaxy clusters. We pay particular attention to the systematic uncertainties in these techniques and to strategies for controlling them at the level needed to exploit “Stage IV” dark energy facilities such as BigBOSS, LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. We brieﬂy review a number of other approaches including redshift-space distortions, the Alcock-Paczynski eﬀect, and direct measurements of the Hubble constant H0. We present extensive forecasts for constraints on the dark energy equation of state and parameterized deviations from General Relativity, achievable with Stage III and Stage IV experimental programs that incorporate supernovae, BAO, weak lensing, and cosmic microwave background data. We also show the level of precision required for clusters or other methods to provide constraints competitive with those of these ﬁducial programs. We emphasize the value of a balanced program that employs several of the most powerful methods in combination, both to cross-check systematic uncertainties and to take advantage of complementary information. Surveys to probe cosmic acceleration produce data sets that support a wide range of scientiﬁc investigations, and they continue the longstanding astronomical tradition of mapping the universe in ever greater detail over ever larger scales.},

	abstract = {The Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) is a multi-band imaging survey designed for cosmological studies from weak lensing and photometric redshifts. It uses the European Southern Observatory VLT Survey Telescope with its wide-ﬁeld camera OmegaCAM. KiDS images are taken in four ﬁlters similar to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugri bands. The best seeing time is reserved for deep r-band observations. The median 5σ limiting AB magnitude is 24.9 and the median seeing is below 0.7 arcsec. Initial KiDS observations have concentrated on the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) regions near the celestial equator, where extensive, highly complete redshift catalogues are available. A total of 109 survey tiles, 1 square degree each, form the basis of the ﬁrst set of lensing analyses of halo properties of GAMA galaxies. Nine galaxies per square arcminute enter the lensing analysis, for an effective inverse shear variance of 69 arcmin−2. Accounting for the shape measurement weight, the median redshift of the sources is 0.53. KiDS data processing follows two parallel tracks, one optimized for weak lensing measurement and one for accurate matched-aperture photometry (for photometric redshifts). This technical paper describes the lensing and photometric redshift measurements (including a detailed description of the Gaussian aperture and photometry pipeline), summarizes the data quality and presents extensive tests for systematic errors that might affect the lensing analyses. We also provide ﬁrst demonstrations of the suitability of the data for cosmological measurements, and describe our blinding procedure for preventing conﬁrmation bias in the scientiﬁc analyses.

If the observed ellipticities are induced by weak gravitational lensing, then the distortion ﬁeld is curl-free. Here we show that, in contrast, the distortion ﬁeld resulting from intrinsic spin alignments is not curl-free. This provides a powerful discriminant between lensing and intrinsic contributions to observed ellipticity correlations. We also show how these contributions can be disentangled statistically from the ellipticity correlations or computed locally from circular integrals of the ellipticity ﬁeld. This allows for an unambiguous detection of intrinsic galaxy alignments in the data. When the distortions are dominated by lensing, as occurs at high redshifts, the decomposition provides a valuable tool for understanding properties of the noise and systematic errors. These techniques can be applied equally well to the polarization of the microwave background, where it can be used to separate curl-free scalar perturbations from those produced by gravity waves or defects.},

	abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing by the large scale structure can be used to probe the dark matter distribution in the Universe directly and thus to probe cosmological models. The recent detection of cosmic shear by several groups has demonstrated the feasibility of this new mode of observational cosmology. In the currently most extensive analysis of cosmic shear, it was found that the shear ﬁeld contains unexpected modes, so-called B-modes, which are thought to be unaccountable for by lensing. B-modes can in principle be generated by an intrinsic alignment of galaxies from which the shear is measured, or may signify some remaining systematics in the data reduction and analysis. In this paper we show that B-modes in fact are produced by lensing itself. The eﬀect comes about through the clustering of source galaxies, which in particular implies an angular separation-dependent clustering in redshift. After presenting the theory of the decomposition of a general shear ﬁeld into E- and B-modes, we calculate their respective power spectra and correlation functions for a clustered source distribution. Numerical and analytical estimates of the relative strength of these two modes show that the resulting B-mode is very small on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes, but its relative contribution rises quickly towards smaller angular scales, with comparable power in both modes at a few arcseconds. The relevance of this eﬀect with regard to the current cosmic shear surveys is discussed; it can not account for the apparent detection of a B-mode contribution on large angular scales in the cosmic shear analysis of van Waerbeke et al. (2002).},

	abstract = {Cosmic shear is the distortion of images of distant galaxies due to weak gravitational lensing by the large-scale structure in the Universe. Such images are coherently deformed by the tidal field of matter inhomogeneities along the line of sight. By measuring galaxy shape correlations, we can study the properties and evolution of structure on large scales as well as the geometry of the Universe. Thus, cosmic shear has become a powerful probe into the nature of dark matter and the origin of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe. Over the last years, cosmic shear has evolved into a reliable and robust cosmological probe, providing measurements of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of its structure. We review here the principles of weak gravitational lensing and show how cosmic shear is interpreted in a cosmological context. Then we give an overview of weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear results since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for cosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and missions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and discuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future observations.},

	abstract = {This work, together with its companion paper, Secco and Samuroff et al. (2021), presents the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 cosmic shear measurements and cosmological constraints based on an analysis of over 100 million source galaxies. With the data spanning 4143 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ on the sky, divided into four redshift bins, we produce the highest significance measurement of cosmic shear to date, with a signal-to-noise of 40. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model and find a 3\% constraint of the clustering amplitude, \$S\_8{\textbackslash}equiv {\textbackslash}sigma\_8 ({\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}rm m\}/0.3){\textasciicircum}\{0.5\} = 0.759{\textasciicircum}\{+0.025\}\_\{-0.023\}\$. A \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM-Optimized analysis, which safely includes smaller scale information, yields a 2\% precision measurement of \$S\_8= 0.772{\textasciicircum}\{+0.018\}\_\{-0.017\}\$ that is consistent with the fiducial case. The two low-redshift measurements are statistically consistent with the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background result, however, both recovered \$S\_8\$ values are lower than the high-redshift prediction by \$2.3{\textbackslash}sigma\$ and \$2.1{\textbackslash}sigma\$ (\$p\$-values of 0.02 and 0.05), respectively. The measurements are shown to be internally consistent across redshift bins, angular scales and correlation functions. The analysis is demonstrated to be robust to calibration systematics, with the \$S\_8\$ posterior consistent when varying the choice of redshift calibration sample, the modeling of redshift uncertainty and methodology. Similarly, we find that the corrections included to account for the blending of galaxies shifts our best-fit \$S\_8\$ by \$0.5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ without incurring a substantial increase in uncertainty. We examine the limiting factors for the precision of the cosmological constraints and find observational systematics to be subdominant to the modeling of astrophysics. Specifically, we identify the uncertainties in modeling baryonic effects and intrinsic alignments as the limiting systematics.},

These galaxy-galaxy measurements are used in the DES Y3 3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt cosmological analysis, which combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering information. We use two lens samples: a magnitude-limited sample and the redMaGic sample, which span the redshift range \${\textbackslash}sim 0.2-1\$ with 10.7 M and 2.6 M galaxies respectively. For the source catalog, we use the Metacalibration shape sample, consisting of \${\textbackslash}simeq\$100 M galaxies separated into 4 tomographic bins. Our galaxy-galaxy lensing estimator is the mean tangential shear, for which we obtain a total S/N of \${\textbackslash}sim\$148 for MagLim (\${\textbackslash}sim\$120 for redMaGic), and \${\textbackslash}sim\$67 (\${\textbackslash}sim\$55) after applying the scale cuts of 6 Mpc/\$h\$. Thus we reach percent-level statistical precision, which requires that our modeling and systematic-error control be of comparable accuracy. The tangential shear model used in the 3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt cosmological analysis includes lens magnification, a five-parameter intrinsic alignment model (TATT), marginalization over a point-mass to remove information from small scales and a linear galaxy bias model validated with higher-order terms. We explore the impact of these choices on the tangential shear observable and study the significance of effects not included in our model, such as reduced shear, source magnification and source clustering. We also test the robustness of our measurements to various observational and systematics effects, such as the impact of observing conditions, lens-source clustering, random-point subtraction, scale-dependent Metacalibration responses, PSF residuals, and B-modes.},

DECam utilizes four pairs of intra/extra-focal CCDs located on the edge of the focal plane for wavefront sensing. Out-of-focus stars are selected, individually ﬁt to a pupil plane Zernike expansion and then collectively analyzed in the time between exposures. The AOS uses this information to control the prime-focus camera’s ﬁve degrees of freedom. The AOS is now in routine use, operating with unsupervised control of the focus and camera alignment, both for the Dark Energy Survey and community observing. The design, commissioning and operation of the AOS along with results from the wavefront measurements are described. In particular, wavefront measurements of the complete optical system, including primary mirror aberrations, are shown. Lastly, preliminary results using these wavefront measurements to model the DECam point spread function are presented.},

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Significant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and finally processing with Rubin’s LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep area of approximately 300 deg2, as well as a deep drilling field of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 yr of the planned 10 yr survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the data set to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic test bed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientific ideas in both static and time domain cosmology.},

	abstract = {Metacalibration is a new technique for measuring weak gravitational lensing shear that is unbiased for isolated galaxy images. In this work we test metacalibration with overlapping, or “blended” galaxy images. Using standard metacalibration, we ﬁnd a few percent shear measurement bias for galaxy densities relevant for current surveys, and that this bias increases with increasing galaxy number density. We show that this bias is not due to blending itself, but rather to shear-dependent object detection. If object detection is shear independent, no deblending of images is needed, in principle. We demonstrate that detection biases are accurately removed when including object detection in the metacalibration process, a technique we call metadetection. This process involves applying an artiﬁcial shear to images of small regions of sky and performing detection on the sheared images, as well as measurements that are used to calculate a shear response. We demonstrate that the method can accurately recover weak shear signals even in highly blended scenes. In the metacalibration process, the space between objects is sheared coherently, which does not perfectly match the real universe in which some, but not all, galaxy images are sheared coherently. We ﬁnd that even for the worst case scenario, in which the space between objects is completely unsheared, the resulting shear bias is at most a few tenths of a percent for future surveys. We discuss additional technical challenges that must be met in order to implement metadetection for real surveys.},

	abstract = {We present the first cosmology results from large-scale structure in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) spanning 5000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$. We perform an analysis combining three two-point correlation functions (3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt): (i) cosmic shear using 100 million source galaxies, (ii) galaxy clustering, and (iii) the cross-correlation of source galaxy shear with lens galaxy positions. The analysis was designed to mitigate confirmation or observer bias; we describe specific changes made to the lens galaxy sample following unblinding of the results. We model the data within the flat \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM and \$w\$CDM cosmological models. We find consistent cosmological results between the three two-point correlation functions; their combination yields clustering amplitude \$S\_8=0.776{\textasciicircum}\{+0.017\}\_\{-0.017\}\$ and matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.339{\textasciicircum}\{+0.032\}\_\{-0.031\}\$ in \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM, mean with 68\% confidence limits; \$S\_8=0.775{\textasciicircum}\{+0.026\}\_\{-0.024\}\$, \${\textbackslash}Omega\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}\} = 0.352{\textasciicircum}\{+0.035\}\_\{-0.041\}\$, and dark energy equation-of-state parameter \$w=-0.98{\textasciicircum}\{+0.32\}\_\{-0.20\}\$ in \$w\$CDM. This combination of DES data is consistent with the prediction of the model favored by the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) primary anisotropy data, which is quantified with a probability-to-exceed \$p=0.13\$ to \$0.48\$. When combining DES 3\${\textbackslash}times\$2pt data with available baryon acoustic oscillation, redshift-space distortion, and type Ia supernovae data, we find \$p=0.34\$.

	abstract = {We present and characterize the catalog of galaxy shape measurements that will be used for cosmological weak lensing measurements in the Wide layer of the ﬁrst year of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg2 split into six ﬁelds, with a mean i-band seeing of 0.58′′ and 5σ point-source depth of i ∼ 26. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria for ﬁrst year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin−2, respectively. We deﬁne the requirements for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We ﬁnd that the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lensing science with this catalog, with fractional PSF model size residuals of approximately 0.003 (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape correlation function ρ1 {\textless} 3 × 10−7 (requirement: 4 × 10−7) at 0.5◦ scales. A variety of galaxy shape-related null tests are statistically consistent with zero, but star-galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics on on {\textgreater} 1◦ scales that are sufﬁciently large as to require mitigation in cosmic shear measurements. Finally, we discuss the dominant systematics and the planned algorithmic changes to reduce them in future data reductions.},

	abstract = {In this study, we interpret two vertical turbulence measurements. We acquired these uninterrupted high-resolution dissipation rate profiles with the balloon-borne instrument LITOS (Leibniz Institute Turbulence Observations in the Stratosphere) from velocity measurements using a spectral technique. The meteorological situation is characterized using ECMWF’s integrated forecast system (IFS) as breaking Rossby waves showing significant tropospheric jets and a developed tropopause fold. In both cases, dissipation rates in the shear zone above the upper-tropospheric jet are three orders of magnitude larger than below, reaching severe turbulence strengths (1,000 mW kg−1) in a deep tropopause fold and moderate turbulence strengths in a medium tropopause fold (10 mW kg−1). These turbulent spots are shown to create a tripole shaped pattern of PV modification across the tropopause. Furthermore, tracertracer correlations exhibit mixing of tropospheric and stratospheric air masses in the medium-fold case. While the strength of turbulence corresponds to the depth of the tropopause fold, its asymmetric vertical distribution is possibly related to the tropopause fold life cycle. The observed asymmetry in the vertical turbulence distribution is consistent across both tropopause folds and in overall agreement with measured Richardson numbers. In the medium-fold case however, it is neither expected from conceptual models nor from Richardson numbers in the IFS. This calls for further field campaigns to investigate the role of turbulence and its implications for the meteorological understanding as well as for aviation safety.},

Since the absorption length of silicon depends on wavelength, CCDs are a potential source of PSF chromaticity. Here we develop two toy models to estimate the sensitivity of the cosmic shear survey from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope to chromatic effects in CCDs. We then compare these toy models to simulated estimates of PSF chromaticity derived from the LSST photon simulator PHOSIM. We ﬁnd that even though sensor contributions to PSF chromaticity are subdominant to atmospheric contributions, they can still signiﬁcantly bias cosmic shear results if left uncorrected, particularly in the redder ﬁlter bands and for objects that are off-axis in the ﬁeld of view.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11892},
	abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful statistical tool for probing the growth of cosmic structure and measuring cosmological parameters. However, as shown by studies such as M´enard et al. (2010), dust in the circumgalactic region of haloes dims and reddens background sources. In a weak lensing analysis, this selects against sources behind overdense regions; since there is more structure in overdense regions, we will underestimate the amplitude of density perturbations σ8 if we do not correct for the eﬀects of circumgalactic dust. To model the dust distribution we employ the halo model. Assuming a ﬁducial dust mass proﬁle based on measurements from M´enard et al. (2010), we compute the ratio Z of the systematic error to the statistical error for a survey similar to the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope reference survey (2000 deg2 area, single-ﬁlter eﬀective source density 30 galaxies arcmin−2). For a waveband centered at 1580 nm (H-band), we ﬁnd that ZH = 0.37. For a similar survey with waveband centered at 620 nm (r-band), we also computed Zr = 2.8. Within our ﬁducial dust model, since Zr {\textgreater} 1, the systematic eﬀect of dust will be signiﬁcant on weak lensing image surveys. We also computed the dust bias on the amplitude of the power spectrum, σ8, and found it to be for each waveband ∆σ8/σ8 = −3.1 × 10−4 (H band) or −2.2 × 10−3 (r band) if all other parameters are held ﬁxed (the forecast Roman statistical-only error σ(σ8)/σ8 is 9 × 10−4).},

	abstract = {We develop and test a method for measuring the gravitational lensing induced distortion of faint background galaxies. We ﬁrst describe how we locate the galaxies and measure a 2-component ‘polarisation’ or ellipticity statistic eα whose expectation value should be proportional to the gravitational shear γα. We then show that an anisotropic instrumental psf perturbs the polarisation by δeα = Pαsβ pβ, where pα is a measure of the psf anisotropy and Pαsβ is the ‘linearised smear polarisability tensor’. By estimating Pαsβ for each object we can determine pα from the foreground stars and apply a correction −Pαsβpβ to the galaxies. We test this procedure using deep high-resolution images from HST which are smeared with an anisotropic psf and then have noise added to simulate ground-based observations. We ﬁnd that the procedure works very well. A similar analysis yields a linear shear polarisability tensor Pαγβ which describes the response to a gravitational shear. This calibrates the polarisation-shear relation, but only for galaxies which are well resolved. To empirically calibrate the eﬀect of seeing on the smaller galaxies we artiﬁcially stretch HST images to simulate lensing and then degrade them as before. These experiments provide a rigorous and exacting test of the method under realistic conditions. They show that it is possible to remove the eﬀect of instrumental psf anisotropy, and that the method provides an eﬃcient and quantitative measurement of the gravitational shear.},

	abstract = {When simulating sky images, one often takes a galaxy image F (x) deﬁned by a set of pixelized samples and an interpolation kernel, and then wants to produce a new sampled image representing this galaxy as it would appear with a diﬀerent point-spread function, a rotation, shearing, or magniﬁcation, and/or a diﬀerent pixel scale. These operations are sometimes only possible, or most eﬃciently executed, as resamplings of the Fourier transform F˜(u) of the image onto a u-space grid that diﬀers from the one produced by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the samples. In some applications it is essential that the resampled image be accurate to better than 1 part in 103, so in this paper we ﬁrst use standard Fourier techniques to show that Fourier-domain interpolation with a wrapped sinc function yields the exact value of F˜(u) in terms of the input samples and kernel. This operation scales with image dimension as N 4 and can be prohibitively slow, so we next investigate the errors accrued from approximating the sinc function with a compact kernel. We show that these approximations produce a multiplicative error plus a pair of ghost images (in each dimension) in the simulated image. Standard Lanczos or cubic interpolators, when applied in Fourier domain, produce unacceptable artifacts. We ﬁnd that errors {\textless} 1 part in 103 can be obtained by (1) 4-fold zero-padding of the original image before executing the x → u DFT, followed by (2) resampling to the desired u grid using a 6-point, piecewise-quintic interpolant that we design expressly to minimize the ghosts, then (3) executing the DFT back to x domain.},

The most successful methods are shown to achieve percent level accuracy. From the cosmic shear pipelines that have been used to constrain cosmology, we ﬁnd weak lensing shear measured to an accuracy that is within the statistical errors of current weak lensing analyses, with shear measurements accurate to better than 7\%. The dominant source of measurement error is shown to arise from calibration uncertainties where the measured shear is over or under-estimated by a constant multiplicative factor. This is of concern as calibration errors cannot be detected through standard diagnostic tests. The measured calibration errors appear to result from stellar contamination, false object detection, the shear measurement method itself, selection bias and/or the use of biased weights. Additive systematics (false detections of shear) resulting from residual point-spread function anisotropy are, in most cases, reduced to below an equivalent shear of 0.001, an order of magnitude below cosmic shear distortions on the scales probed by current surveys.},

Compared with a traditional MASS, which uses atmospheric scintillation within four concentric annular apertures, the new method utilizes scintillation in several hundreds of spatial patterns, which are created by combinations of SH-WFS subapertures. Accuracy of the turbulence proﬁle reconstruction is evaluated with Bayesian inference, and it is conﬁrmed that the turbulence proﬁle with more than 10 layers can be reconstructed because of the large number of constraints. We demonstrate the new method with a SH-WFS attached to the 51-cm telescope at Tohoku University and we conﬁrm that the general characteristics of the atmospheric turbulence proﬁle are reproduced.},

We aim to estimate the vertical distribution of the wavefront outer scale.

We use a simulated annealing algorithm to deduce the height dependence of the wavefront outer scale with given C2N proﬁles simultaneously measured with the scintillation detection and ranging (SCIDAR) instrument. We present results obtained during two campaigns of observation at the Mauna Kea Observatory (Hawaii) and the Observatoire de Haute Provence (France).

	abstract = {We describe an online method to estimate the wavefront outer scale proﬁle, L0(h), for very large and future extremely large telescopes. The stratiﬁed information on this parameter impacts the estimation of the main turbulence parameters [turbulence strength, Cn2(h); Fried’s parameter, r0; isoplanatic angle, θ 0; and coherence time, τ 0) and determines the performance of wideﬁeld adaptive optics (AO) systems. This technique estimates L0(h) using data from the AO loop available at the facility instruments by constructing the cross-correlation functions of the slopes between two or more wavefront sensors, which are later ﬁtted to a linear combination of the simulated theoretical layers having different altitudes and outer scale values. We analyse some limitations found in the estimation process: (i) its insensitivity to large values of L0(h) as the telescope becomes blind to outer scales larger than its diameter; (ii) the maximum number of observable layers given the limited number of independent inputs that the cross-correlation functions provide and (iii) the minimum length of data required for a satisfactory convergence of the turbulence parameters without breaking the assumption of statistical stationarity of the turbulence. The method is applied to the Gemini South multiconjugate AO system that comprises ﬁve wavefront sensors and two deformable mirrors. Statistics of L0(h) at Cerro Pacho´n from data acquired during 3 yr of campaigns show interesting resemblance to other independent results in the literature. A ﬁnal analysis suggests that the impact of error sources will be substantially reduced in instruments of the next generation of giant telescopes.},

It is especially crucial for weak gravitational lensing, in order to beat down systematics and allow one to reach the full potential of weak lensing in measuring dark energy. A PSF modelling pipeline is made of two main steps: the ﬁrst one is to assess its shape on stars, and the second is to interpolate it at any desired position (usually galaxies). We focus on the second part, and compare different interpolation schemes, including polynomial interpolation, radial basis functions, Delaunay triangulation and Kriging. For that purpose, we develop simulations of PSF ﬁelds, in which stars are built from a set of basis functions deﬁned from a principal components analysis of a real ground-based image. We ﬁnd that Kriging gives the most reliable interpolation, signiﬁcantly better than the traditionally used polynomial interpolation. We also note that although a Kriging interpolation on individual images is enough to control systematics at the level necessary for current weak lensing surveys, more elaborate techniques will have to be developed to reach future ambitious surveys’ requirements.},

The description is focused upon the speciﬁc problem of modelling the spatial variation of a telescope point spread function (PSF) across the instrument ﬁeld of view, a crucial stage in lensing data analysis, but the technique may be used to rank competing models wherever data are described empirically. As such it may, with further development, provide useful extra information when used in combination with existing model selection techniques such as the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, or the Bayesian evidence. Two independent diagnostic correlation functions are described, and the interpretation of these functions is demonstrated by using a simulated PSF anisotropy ﬁeld. The efﬁcacy of these diagnostic functions as an aid to the correct choice of empirical model is then demonstrated by analysing results for a suite of Monte Carlo simulations of random PSF ﬁelds with varying degrees of spatial structure, and it is shown how the diagnostic functions can be related to requirements for precision cosmic shear measurement. The limitations of the technique, and opportunities for improvements and applications to ﬁelds other than weak gravitational lensing, are discussed.},

Results. If a von Kàrmàn turbulence model is adopted, a simple approximate formula predicts the dependence of atmospheric longexposure resolution on the outer scale over the entire practically interesting range of telescope diameters and wavelengths. In the infrared (IR), the diﬀerence from the standard Kolmogorov seeing formula can exceed a factor of two. We ﬁnd that a low-order adaptive turbulence correction produces residual wavefronts eﬀectively of small outer scale, so even a very low compensation order leads to a substantial improvement in resolution over seeing, compared to the standard theory.
Conclusions. Seeing-limited resolution of large telescopes, especially in the IR, is currently under estimated by not accounting for the outer scale. On the other hand, adaptive-optics systems optimized for diﬀraction-limited imaging in the IR can improve the resolution in the visible by as much as a factor of two.},

We demonstrate that we are able to: 1) construct kilometer scale phase screens necessary for wide-ﬁeld telescopes, 2) reproduce atmospheric point-spread-function moments using a fast novel hybrid geometric/Fourier technique for non-diﬀraction limited telescopes, 3) accurately reproduce the expected spot diagrams for complex aspheric optical designs, and 4) recover system eﬀective area predicted from analytic photometry integrals. This new code, the photon simulator (PhoSim), is publicly available. We have implemented the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) design, and it can be extended to other telescopes. We expect that because of the comprehensive physics implemented in PhoSim, it will be used by the community to plan future observations, interpret detailed existing observations, and quantify systematics related to various astronomical measurements. Future development and validation by comparisons with real data will continue to improve the ﬁdelity and usability of the code.},

	abstract = {A main science goal for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is to measure the cosmic shear signal from weak lensing to extreme accuracy. One difﬁculty, however, is that with the short exposure time ( 15 s) proposed, the spatial variation of the point spread function (PSF) shapes may be dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics errors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a single CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide range of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multiscale, complex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in the ﬁeld. In this paper we present a new method, PSFENT, for interpolating the PSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps with a multiscale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from the LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a ﬁfth-order polynomial ﬁt (representing the current standard) and a simple boxcar smoothing technique. Quantitatively, PSFENT predicts more accurate PSF models in all scenarios and the residual PSF errors are spatially less correlated. This improvement in PSF interpolation leads to a factor of 3.5 lower systematic errors in the shear power spectrum on scales smaller than ∼13 arcmin, compared to polynomial ﬁtting. We estimate that with PSFENT and for stellar densities greater than 1 arcmin−2, the spurious shear correlation from PSF interpolation, after combining a complete 10-yr data set from LSST, is lower than the corresponding statistical uncertainties on the cosmic shear power spectrum, even under a conservative scenario.},

	abstract = {For ground-based optical imaging with current CCD technology, the Poisson ﬂuctuations in source and sky background photon arrivals dominate the noise budget and are readily estimated. Another component of noise, however, is the signal from the undetected population of stars and galaxies. Using injection of artiﬁcal galaxies into images, we demonstrate that the measured variance of galaxy moments (used for weak gravitational lensing measurements) in Dark Energy Survey (DES) images is signiﬁcantly in excess of the Poisson predictions, by up to 30\%, and that the background sky levels are overestimated by current software. By cross-correlating distinct images of “empty” sky regions, we establish that there is a signiﬁcant image noise contribution from undetected static sources (US), which on average are mildly resolved at DES resolution. Treating these US as a stationary noise source, we compute a correction to the moment covariance matrix expected from Poisson noise. The corrected covariance matrix matches the moment variances measured on the injected DES images to within 5\%. Thus we have an empirical method to statistically account for US in weak lensing measurements, rather than requiring extremely deep sky simulations. We also ﬁnd that local sky determinations can remove the bias in ﬂux measurements, at a small penalty in additional, but quantiﬁable, noise.},

Typically, the layers are ∼15–130 m thick and have a distance of ∼60–270 m, and their number increases with altitude. Due to the very high measurement resolution of LITOS in the range of millimeters, we obtain energy dissipation rate proﬁles with unprecedented precision. Within the turbulent layers we get a mean dissipation rate of 3.4×10−2 W/kg (BEXUS 6) and 1.1×10−2 W/kg (BEXUS 8) corresponding to a heating rate of 1 to ∼3 K/d. The proﬁles show an increase of the energy dissipation with altitude. Comparisons with the Richardson number Ri preclude a clear correlation between the occurrence of turbulence and Ri {\textless}1∕4. Despite the expected occurrence of turbulence at Ri {\textless} 1/4, we also observed turbulent layers where Ri was {\textgreater}1∕4 and far beyond, independent of the scale over which Ri has been determined.},

	abstract = {The complexity of computing conventional matrix multiply wave-front reconstructors scales as O(n3) for most adaptive optical (AO) systems, where n is the number of deformable mirror (DM) actuators. This is impractical for proposed systems with extremely large n. It is known that sparse matrix methods improve this scaling for least-squares reconstructors, but sparse techniques are not immediately applicable to the minimum-variance reconstructors now favored for multiconjugate adaptive optical (MCAO) systems with multiple wave-front sensors (WFSs) and DMs. Complications arise from the nonsparse statistics of atmospheric turbulence, and the global tip/tilt WFS measurement errors associated with laser guide star (LGS) position uncertainty. A description is given of how sparse matrix methods can still be applied by use of a sparse approximation for turbulence statistics and by recognizing that the nonsparse matrix terms arising from LGS position uncertainty are low-rank adjustments that can be evaluated by using the matrix inversion lemma. Sample numerical results for AO and MCAO systems illustrate that the approximation made to turbulence statistics has negligible effect on estimation accuracy, the time to compute the sparse minimum-variance reconstructor for a conventional natural guide star AO system scales as O(n3/2) and is only a few seconds for n=3500, and sparse techniques reduce the reconstructor computations by a factor of 8 for sample MCAO systems with 2417 DM actuators and 4280 WFS subapertures. With extrapolation to 9700 actuators and 17,120 subapertures, a reduction by a factor of approximately 30 or 40 to 1 is predicted.},

The catalog is based on a trillion-particle, (4.225 Gpc)3 box cosmological N-body simulation, the Outer Rim run. It covers 440deg2 of sky area to a redshift of z=3 and matches expected number densities from contemporary surveys to a magnitude depth of 28 in the r band. Each galaxy is characterized by a multitude of galaxy properties including stellar mass, morphology, spectral energy distributions, broadband ﬁlter magnitudes, host halo information, and weak lensing shear. The size and complexity of cosmoDC2 requires an efﬁcient catalog generation methodology; our approach is based on a new hybrid technique that combines data-based empirical approaches with semianalytic galaxy modeling. A wide range of observation-based validation tests has been implemented to ensure that cosmoDC2 enables the science goals of the planned LSSTDESC DC2 analyses.

The computation of the resulting bias in the shear power spectrum scales as the ﬁfth power of the maximum multipole considered. Consequently the calculation is unfeasible for large ℓ-modes, and the only tractable way to assess the full impact of shape measurement biases on cosmic shear power spectrum is through forward modelling of the eﬀects. To linear order in bias parameters the shear power spectrum is only aﬀected by the mean of the multiplicative bias ﬁeld over a survey and the cross correlation between the additive bias ﬁeld and the shear ﬁeld.

Daytime surface wind speeds are shown to be broadly consistent with the Weibull distribution, while nighttime surface wind speeds are generally more positively skewed than the corresponding Weibull distribution (particularly in summer). In the midlatitudes, these strongly positive skewnesses are shown to be generally associated with conditions of strong surface stability and weak lower-tropospheric wind shear. Long-term tower observations from Cabauw, the Netherlands, and Los Alamos, New Mexico, demonstrate that lower-tropospheric wind speeds become more positively skewed than the corresponding Weibull distribution only in the shallow (;50 m) nocturnal boundary layer. This skewness is associated with two populations of nighttime winds: (i) strongly stably stratiﬁed with strong wind shear and (ii) weakly stably or unstably stratiﬁed with weak wind shear. Using an idealized two-layer model of the boundary layer momentum budget, it is shown that the observed variability of the daytime and nighttime surface wind speeds can be accounted for through a stochastic representation of intermittent turbulent mixing at the nocturnal boundary layer inversion.},

Some 28 000 low-resolution proﬁles were measured by a new MASS single-star turbulence monitor, accompanied by seeing data from DIMM. The median seeing was 0.95 arcsec. The ﬁrst 500 m contribute 60 per cent to the total seeing, and the free-atmosphere median seeing was 0.55 arcsec. The free-atmosphere seeing is almost never better than 0.15 arcsec because there is always some turbulence above 12 km. A 4-d period of calm upper atmosphere with a stable free-atmosphere seeing of 0.2–0.3 arcsec was noted. The gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of the ground layer will be typically 1.7 times, and 2–3 times during such calm periods. Correlations of the freeatmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at the tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with the ground wind are studied. The temporal evolution of turbulence is characterized by recurrent bursts, their typical duration increasing from 15 min in low layers to 1–2 h in high layers. The large data base of turbulence proﬁles can be used to test mesoscale modelling of astronomical seeing.},

These works aimed at validating the atmospheric model Meso-Nh which was conceived to simulate classical atmospheric parameters and was then adapted to simulate optical turbulence (3D maps of CN2 ). Good results were obtained but further improvements can be made. One of the principal limitations is the statistical reliability of the model that is, at the present time, not very high. In this paper we present some modiﬁcations introduced in the optical turbulence parameterization of the model that aim to reduce some systematic errors. Preliminary results, obtained comparing the simulations with measurements taken at the San Pedro M´artir site (Mexico) in March–April 1997, show that we are now able to obtain a better qualitative and quantitative estimate of the CN2 proﬁles. Finally, we show how we have been able to improve the spatiotemporal variability of the model.},

	abstract = {The forecast for atmospheric and turbulence conditions above astronomical observatories is of interest to the astronomical community because it allows observations to be planned with maximum efﬁciency, a process called ﬂexible scheduling. It can also be used to simulate long-term site testing to provide local information useful for the conception of focal and post-focal instrumentation. We have presented our forecasting tool in previous publications, but in this paper we focus on the importance of using local measurements to improve the predictive turbulence model and to better consider the local speciﬁcities of a given site, a process we call site learning. For this study, we use a local data base provided by the Calern Atmospheric Turbulence Station, which has been operational since 2015 at Calern Observatory. In addition, we use a set of several months of predictions to feed the turbulence model, taking into account daytime and nighttime conditions. This upgrade improves the quality of our forecasting by reducing the absolute bias between measurements and predictions from 25 to 50 per cent for each layer of the Cn2, by 25 per cent for the seeing, and by 70 per cent for the isoplanatic angle.},

In this study, we perform retrospective simulations of optical turbulence over the Hawaiian islands using a mesoscale model. The simulated results are validated against thermosonde data. We focus on turbulence in the free atmosphere, above the atmospheric boundary layer. The free atmosphere is particularly important for adaptive optics performance and for sky coverage calculations and hence has signiﬁcant impact on performance optimization and scheduling of observations. We demonstrate that a vertical grid spacing of 100 m or ﬁner is needed to faithfully capture the intrinsic variabilities of observed clear air turbulence. This is a particularly timely study because the next generation of extremely large telescopes are currently under construction and their associated suite of instruments are in the design phase. Knowledge of the expected accuracy of optical turbulence simulations and real-time forecasts will enable the design teams to (i) test and develop instrument designs and (ii) formulate operational procedure.},

Previsions are obtained with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in combination with the Trinquet–Vernin (TV) model, which allows us to compute the optical turbulence from the vertical gradient of the temperature and the wind velocity. The ﬁrst aim of this study is to demonstrate the ability of the WRF model to reproduce the spatial evolution of the weather and especially the optical conditions, even using low-resolution input data. The second purpose is the deﬁnition of a quality parameter Q, which can be used to determine and discriminate between astronomical sites. More than 4500 h of simulations were calculated in 2009 and we present an average of these predictions over a 2D grid. The results show that the WRF model is able to simulate the spatial evolution of the weather at a better resolution than the coarse input data and it adapts the dynamic ﬂow to the terrain orography. The quality parameter is applied to the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos at La Palma and shows that it is, within 2 km precision, installed at the best possible location on the island.},

Here we compare these astro-meteorological parameters as well as the vertical proﬁle itself from a forecast model based on a General Circulation Model from the European Centre for Median range Weather Forecasts and the stereo-SCIDAR, a highsensitivity turbulence proﬁling instrument in regular operation at Paranal, Chile. The model is fast to process as no spatial nesting or data manipulation is performed. This speed enables the model to be reactive based on the most up to date forecasts. We ﬁnd that the model is statistically consistent with measurements from stereo-SCIDAR. The correlation of the median turbulence proﬁle from the model and the measurement is 0.98. We also ﬁnd that the distributions of astro-meteorological parameters are consistent. We compare contemporaneous measurements and show that the free atmosphere seeing, isoplanatic angle and coherence time have correlation values of 0.64, 0.40 and 0.63 respectively. We show and compare the proﬁle sequences from a large number of trial nights. We see that the model is able to forecast the evolution of dominating features. In addition to smart scheduling, ensuring that the most sensitive astronomical observations are scheduled for the optimum time, this model could enable remote site characterisation using a large archive of weather forecasts and could be used to optimise the performance of wide-ﬁeld AO system.},

We present an exact expression for the number of galaxy pairs in this term based on the survey mask, which leads to more than a factor of three increase in the shape noise on the largest measured scales for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KIDS-450) real-space cosmic shear data. We compare the result of this analytic expression to several alternative methods for measuring the shape noise from the data and ﬁnd excellent agreement. This update to the covariance resolves any internal model tension evidenced by the previously large cosmological best-ﬁt χ2 for the KiDS-450 cosmic shear data. The best-ﬁt χ2 is reduced from 161 to 121 for 118 degrees of freedom. We also apply a correction to how the multiplicative shear calibration uncertainty is included in the covariance. This change shifts the inferred amplitude of the correlation function to higher values. We ﬁnd that this improves agreement of the KiDS-450 cosmic shear results with Dark Energy Survey Year 1 and Planck results.},

The velocity of atmospheric optical turbulence is an important parameter for several applications including astronomical adaptive optics systems. Here, we compare the vertical proﬁle of the velocity of the atmospheric wind above La Palma by means of a comparison of Stereo-SCIntillation Detection And Ranging (StereoSCIDAR) with the Global Forecast System models and nearby balloon-borne radiosondes. We use these data to validate the automated optical turbulence velocity identiﬁcation from the Stereo-SCIDAR instrument mounted on the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope, La Palma. By comparing these data we infer that the turbulence velocity and the wind velocity are consistent and that the automated turbulence velocity identiﬁcation of the Stereo-SCIDAR is precise. The turbulence velocities can be used to increase the sensitivity of the turbulence strength proﬁles, as weaker turbulence that may be misinterpreted as noise can be detected with a velocity vector. The turbulence velocities can also be used to increase the altitude resolution of a detected layer, as the altitude of the velocity vectors can be identiﬁed to a greater precision than the native resolution of the system. We also show examples of complex velocity structure within a turbulent layer caused by wind shear at the interface of atmospheric zones.},

The data shows an anisotropic turbulence pattern with an orientation independent of the wind direction and wind speed. We ﬁnd the amplitude of the high spatial frequencies to decrease with increasing exposure time as t−1/2, and ﬁnd a negligibly small atmospheric contribution to the Point Spread Function ellipticity variation for exposure times t {\textgreater} 180 seconds. For future surveys analysing shorter exposure data, this anisotropic turbulence will need to be taken into account as the amplitude of the correlated atmospheric distortions becomes comparable to a cosmological lensing signal on scales less than ∼ 10 arcminutes. This effect could be mitigated, however, by correlating galaxy shear measured on exposures imaged with a time separation greater than 50 seconds, for which we ﬁnd the spatial turbulence patterns to be uncorrelated.},

	abstract = {We present the source separation framework scarlet for multi-band images, which is based on a generalization of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization to alternative and several simultaneous constraints. Our approach describes the observed scene as a mixture of components with compact spatial support and uniform spectra over their support. We present the algorithm to perform the matrix factorization and introduce constraints that are useful for optical images of stars and distinct stellar populations in galaxies, in particular symmetry and monotonicity with respect to the source peak position. We also derive the treatment of correlated noise and convolutions with band-dependent point spread functions, rendering our approach applicable to coadded images observed under variable seeing conditions. scarlet thus yields a PSF-matched photometry measurement with an optimally chosen weight function given by the mean morphology in all available bands. We demonstrate the performance of scarlet for deblending crowded extragalactic scenes and on an AGN jet – host galaxy separation problem in deep 5-band imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Stategic Survey Program. Using simulations with prominent crowding we show that scarlet yields superior results to the HSCSDSS deblender for the recovery of total ﬂuxes, colors, and morphologies. Due to its non-parametric nature, a conceptual limitation of scarlet is its sensitivity to undetected sources or multiple stellar population within detected sources, but an iterative strategy that adds components at the location of signiﬁcant residuals appears promising. The code is implemented in Python with C++ extensions and is available at https://github.com/fred3m/scarlet.},

The method implied the use of a dedicated code conceived for the OT called ASTRO-MESO-NH. In this paper, we present results we obtained at conclusion of this project concerning the performances of this method in forecasting the most relevant parameters related to the OT (CN2 , seeing ε, isoplanatic angle θ 0 and wavefront coherence time τ 0). Numerical predictions related to a very rich statistical sample of nights uniformly distributed along a solar year and belonging to different years have been compared to observations, and different statistical operators have been analysed such as the classical bias, root-mean-squared error, σ and more sophisticated statistical operators derived by the contingency tables that are able to quantify the score of success of a predictive method such as the percentage of correct detection (PC) and the probability to detect a parameter within a speciﬁc range of values (POD). The main conclusions of the study tell us that the ASTRO-MESO-NH model provides performances that are already very good to deﬁnitely guarantee a not negligible positive impact on the service mode of top-class telescopes and ELTs. A demonstrator for an automatic and operational version of the ASTRO-MESO-NH model will be soon implemented on the sites of VLT and E-ELT.},

The method involves distorting the image with a small known shear, and calculating the response of a shear estimator to that applied shear. The method was shown to be accurate in moderate-sized simulations with galaxy images that hadrelatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without signiﬁcant selection effects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear response and selection biases. We also observe thatfor images withrelatively low signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the METACALIBRATION process results in signiﬁcant bias, for which we develop a simple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image simulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including tests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread function ellipticity at the ﬁve-percent level. In each simulation we applied a smallfew-percent shear to the galaxy images. We introduced additional challenges that arise in real data, such as detection thresholds, stellar contamination, and missing data. We applied cuts on the measured galaxy properties to induce signiﬁcant selection effects. Using our formalism, we recovered the input shear with an accuracy better than a part in a thousand in all cases.},

We evaluate the bias using a simple but realistic galaxy model and ﬁnd that the effects of noise alone can cause biases of the order of 1–10 per cent on measured shears, which is signiﬁcant for current and future lensing surveys. We evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a bias model as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. This model is then used to correct the simulated measurements. We demonstrate that, for the simple case in which the correct range of galaxy models is used in the ﬁt, the calibration method can reduce noise bias to the level required for estimating cosmic shear in upcoming lensing surveys.},

For future large surveys, shot noise will be so low that other, systematic errors will likely dominate.

In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacriﬁcing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classiﬁcation, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and ﬁnish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

An image’s spin one and three shape properties, typically associated with F - and G-flexion, are actually complicated functions of the galaxy’s intrinsic shape and the telescope’s PSF, in addition to the lensing properties. The same is true for shear. In this work we create a completely analytic mapping from apparent measured galaxy flexions to gravitational flexions by (1) creating simple models for a lensed galaxy and for a PSF whose distortions are dominated by atmospheric smearing and optical aberrations, (2) convolving the two models, and (3) comparing the pre- and post-convolved flexionlike shape variations of the final image. For completeness, we do the same for shear. As expected, telescope astigmatism, coma, and trefoil can corrupt measurements of shear, F -flexion, and G-flexion, especially for small galaxies. We additionally find that PSF size dilutes the flexion signal more rapidly than the shear signal. Moreover, mixing between shears, flexions, and asymmetric aberrations can create additive offsets in lensing measurements that vary with both galaxy size and galaxy ellipticity and flexion values. But all is not lost; by measuring the patterns, we can correct for them.},

In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

A challenge for this technique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapes of distant galaxies. In this paper we investigate noise bias, a systematic error that arises from second order noise terms in the shape measurement process. We ﬁrst derive analytical expressions for the bias of general Maximum Likelihood estimators (MLEs) in the presence of additive noise. We then ﬁnd analytical expressions for a simpliﬁed toy model in which galaxies are modeled and ﬁtted with a Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for this very simple case we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant e↵ect. We also extend our analysis to a more realistic 6-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We ﬁnd that the noise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxies of SNR of 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. This is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the systematics requirements for future all-sky weak lensing surveys. We discuss possible ways to circumvent this e↵ect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in an associated paper.},

	abstract = {The weak-lensing science of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project drives the need to carefully model and separate the instrumental artifacts from the intrinsic shear signal caused by gravitational lensing. The dominant source of the systematics for all ground-based telescopes is the spatial correlation of the point-spread function (PSF) modulated by both atmospheric turbulence and optical aberrations in the telescope and camera system. In this article, we present a full field-of-view simulation of the LSST images by modeling both the atmosphere and the system optics with the most current data for the telescope and camera specifications and the environment. To simulate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, we generated six-layer Kolmogorov/von Kármán phase screens with the parameters estimated from the on-site measurements. LSST will continuously sample the wavefront, correcting the optics alignment and focus. For the optics, we combined the ray-tracing tool ZEMAX and our simulated focal-plane data to introduce realistic residual aberrations and focal-plane height variations. Although this expected focal-plane flatness deviation for LSST is small compared with that of other existing cameras, the fast focal ratio of the LSST optics cause this focal-plane flatness variation and the resulting PSF discontinuities across the CCD boundaries to be significant challenges in our removal of the PSF-induced systematics. We resolve this complication by performing principal component analysis (PCA) CCD by CCD and by interpolating the basis functions derived from the analysis using conventional polynomials. We demonstrate that this PSF correction scheme reduces the residual PSF ellipticity correlation below 10À7 over the cosmologically interesting (dark-matter-dominated) scale 100–3°. From a null test using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Ultra Deep Field (UDF) galaxy images without input shear, we verify that the amplitude of the galaxy ellipticity correlation function, after the PSF correction, is consistent with the shot noise set by the finite number of objects. We conclude that the current optical design and specification for the accuracy in the focal-plane assembly are sufficient to enable the control of the PSF systematics required for weak-lensing science with LSST.},

	abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model- independent estimator.Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25\% gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15\% improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ and dark energy \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}Lambda\$ in an open \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},

	abstract = {Current and future imaging surveys will measure cosmic shear with statistical precision that demands a deeper understanding of potential systematic biases in galaxy shape measurements than has been achieved to date. We use analytic and computational techniques to study the impact on shape measurements of two atmospheric chromatic effects for ground-based surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST): (1) atmospheric differential chromatic refraction and (2) wavelength dependence of seeing. We investigate the effects of using the point-spread function (PSF) measured with stars to determine the shapes of galaxies that have different spectral energy distributions than the stars. We ﬁnd that both chromatic effects lead to signiﬁcant biases in galaxy shape measurements for current and future surveys, if not corrected. Using simulated galaxy images, we ﬁnd a form of chromatic “model bias” that arises when ﬁtting a galaxy image with a model that has been convolved with a stellar, instead of galactic, PSF. We show that both forms of atmospheric chromatic biases can be predicted (and corrected) with minimal model bias by applying an ordered set of perturbative PSFlevel corrections based on machine-learning techniques applied to six-band photometry. Catalog-level corrections do not address the model bias. We conclude that achieving the ultimate precision for weak lensing from current and future ground-based imaging surveys requires a detailed understanding of the wavelength dependence of the PSF from the atmosphere, and from other sources such as optics and sensors.

	abstract = {Methods. We characterise the error made in the shear arising from errors on the PSF. We consider diﬀerent PSF models, from a simple elliptical Gaussian to various shapelet parametrisations. First we derive our results analytically in the case of inﬁnitely small pixels (i.e. inﬁnitely high resolution), then image simulations are used to validate these results and investigate the eﬀect of ﬁnite pixel size in the case of the elliptical Gaussian PSF.
Results. Our results are expressed in terms of the minimum number of stars required to calibrate the PSF in order to ensure that systematic errors are smaller than statistical errors when estimating the cosmological parameters. On scales smaller than the area containing this minimum number of stars, there is not enough information to model the PSF. This means that these small scales should not be used to constrain cosmology unless the instrument and the observing strategy are optimised to make this variability extremely small. The minimum number of stars varies with the square of the star Signal-to-Noise Ratio, with the complexity of thisdepend onwhatyo knowdI on'tkn the PSF and with at half maximum the pixel size. In the case (FWHM) implies a 20\% of an elliptical Gaussian PSF and in the absence of dithering, 2 pixels increase of the minimum number of stars compared to the ideal case per PSF full of inﬁnitely width small aboutspatial PsEscales pixels; 0.9 pixels per PSF FWHM implies a factor 100 increase.
Conclusions. In the case of a good resolution and a typical Signal-to-Noise Ratio distribution of stars, we ﬁnd that current surveys need the PSF to be calibrated over a few stars, which may explain residual systematics on scales smaller than a few arcmins. Future all-sky cosmic shear surveys require the PSF to be calibrated over a region containing about 50 stars. Due to the simplicity of our models these results should be interpreted as optimistic and therefore provide a measure of a systematic “ﬂoor’ intrinsic to shape measurements.},

	abstract = {In weak gravitational lensing, weighted quadrupole moments of the brightness proﬁle in galaxy images are a common way to estimate gravitational shear. We employ general adaptive moments (GLAM ) to study causes of shear bias on a fundamental level and for a practical deﬁnition of an image ellipticity. The GLAM ellipticity has useful properties for any chosen weight proﬁle: the weighted ellipticity is identical to that of isophotes of elliptical images, and in absence of noise and pixellation it is always an unbiased estimator of reduced shear. We show that moment-based techniques, adaptive or unweighted, are similar to a model-based approach in the sense that they can be seen as imperfect ﬁt of an elliptical proﬁle to the image. Due to residuals in the ﬁt, moment-based estimates of ellipticities are prone to underﬁtting bias when inferred from observed images. The estimation is fundamentally limited mainly by pixellation which destroys information on the original, pre-seeing image. We give an optimized estimator for the preseeing GLAM ellipticity and quantify its bias for noise-free images. To deal with images where pixel noise is prominent, we consider a Bayesian approach to infer GLAM ellipticity where, similar to the noise-free case, the ellipticity posterior can be inconsistent with the true ellipticity if we do not properly account for our ignorance about ﬁt residuals. This underﬁtting bias, quantiﬁed in the paper, does not vary with the overall noise level but changes with the pre-seeing brightness proﬁle and the correlation or heterogeneity of pixel noise over the image. Furthermore, when inferring a constant ellipticity or, more relevantly, constant shear from a source sample with a distribution of intrinsic properties (sizes, centroid positions, intrinsic shapes), an additional, now noise-dependent bias arises towards low signal-to-noise if incorrect prior densities for the intrinsic properties are used. We discuss the origin of this prior bias. With regard to a fully-Bayesian lensing analysis, we point out that passing tests with source samples subject to constant shear may not be suﬃcient for an analysis of sources with varying shear.},

However, the storage of photo-z PDFs may present a challenge with increasingly large catalogs, as we face a trade-o↵ between the accuracy of subsequent science measurements and the limitation of ﬁnite storage resources. This paper presents qp, a Python package for manipulating parametrizations of 1-dimensional PDFs, as suitable for photo-z PDF compression. We use qp to investigate the performance of three simple PDF storage formats (quantiles, samples, and step functions) as a function of the number of stored parameters on two realistic mock datasets, representative of upcoming surveys with di↵erent data qualities. We propose some best practices for choosing a photo-z PDF approximation scheme and demonstrate the approach on a science case using performance metrics on both ensembles of individual photo-z PDFs and an estimator of the overall redshift distribution function. We show that both the properties of the set of PDFs we wish to approximate and the ﬁdelity metric(s) chosen a↵ect the optimal parametrization. Additionally, we ﬁnd that quantiles and samples outperform step functions, and we encourage further consideration of these formats for PDF approximation.},

From the color dependence of the PSF, we fit a model between the monochromatic PSF trace radius, \$R\$, and wavelength of the form \$R({\textbackslash}lambda){\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}lambda{\textasciicircum}\{b\}\$. We find values of \$b\$ between -0.2 and -0.5, depending on the epoch and filter. This is consistent with the expectations of a turbulent atmosphere with an outer scale length of \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100\$ m, indicating that the atmosphere is dominating the chromaticity. We find evidence in the best seeing data that the optical system and detector also contribute some wavelength dependence. Meyers and Burchat (2015) showed that \$b\$ must be measured to an accuracy of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.02\$ not to dominate the systematic error budget of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) weak lensing (WL) survey. Using simple image simulations, we find that \$b\$ can be inferred with this accuracy in the \$r\$ and \$i\$-bands for all positions in the LSST field of view, assuming a stellar density of 1 star arcmin\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and that the optical PSF can be accurately modeled. Therefore, it is possible to correct for most, if not all, of the bias that the wavelength-dependent PSF will introduce into an LSST-like WL survey.},

This survey combined the Slope-Detection and Ranging (SLODAR) and Low-Layer SCIntillation Detection And Ranging (SCIDAR) (LOLAS) instruments into a single manually operated instrument capable of measuring the integrated seeing and the optical turbulence proﬁle within the ﬁrst kilometre with spatial and temporal resolutions of 40–80 m and 1 min (SLODAR) or 10–20 m and 5 min (LOLAS). The campaign began in the fall of 2006 and observed for roughly 50–60 h per month. The optical turbulence within the boundary layer is found to be conﬁned within an extremely thin layer (≤80 m), and the optical turbulence arising within the region from 80 to 650 m is normally very weak. Exponential ﬁts to the SLODAR proﬁles give an upper limit on the exponential scaleheight of between 25 and 40 m. The thickness of this layer shows a dependence on the turbulence strength near the ground, and under median conditions the scaleheight is {\textless}28 m. The LOLAS proﬁles show a multiplicity of layers very close to the ground but all within the ﬁrst 40 m. The free-atmosphere seeing measured by the SLODAR is 0.42 arcsec (median) at 0.5 µm and is, importantly, signiﬁcantly better than the typical delivered image quality at the larger telescopes on the mountain. This suggests that the current suite of telescopes on Mauna Kea is largely dominated by a very local seeing either from internal seeing, seeing induced by the ﬂow in/around the enclosures, or from an atmospheric layer very close to the ground. The results from our campaign suggest that groundlayer adaptive optics can be very effective in correcting this turbulence and, in principle, can provide very large corrected ﬁelds of view on Mauna Kea.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the Earth’s atmospheric optical turbulence is critical for astronomical instrumentation. Not only does it enable performance veriﬁcation and optimization of the existing systems, but it is required for the design of future instruments. As a minimum this includes integrated astro-atmospheric parameters such as seeing, coherence time, and isoplanatic angle, but for more sophisticated systems such as wide-ﬁeld adaptive optics enabled instrumentation the vertical structure of the turbulence is also required. Stereo-SCIDAR (Scintillation Detection and Ranging) is a technique speciﬁcally designed to characterize the Earth’s atmospheric turbulence with high-altitude resolution and high sensitivity. Together with ESO (European Southern Observatory), Durham University has commissioned a Stereo-SCIDAR instrument at Cerro Paranal, Chile, the site of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and only 20 km from the site of the future Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Here we provide results from the ﬁrst 18 months of operation at ESO Paranal including instrument comparisons and atmospheric statistics. Based on a sample of 83 nights spread over 22 months covering all seasons, we ﬁnd the median seeing to be 0.64 with 50 per cent of the turbulence conﬁned to an altitude below 2 km and 40 per cent below 600 m. The median coherence time and isoplanatic angle are found as 4.18 ms and 1.75 , respectively. A substantial campaign of inter-instrument comparison was also undertaken to assure the validity of the data. The Stereo-SCIDAR proﬁles (optical turbulence strength and velocity as a function of altitude) have been compared with the Surface-Layer Slope Detection And Ranging, Multi-Aperture Scintillation Sensor-Differential Image Motion Monitor, and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts model. The correlation coefﬁcients are between 0.61 (isoplanatic angle) and 0.84 (seeing).},

	abstract = {The next generation of adaptive optics (AO) systems will require tomographic reconstruction techniques to map the optical refractive index ﬂuctuations, generated by the atmospheric turbulence, along the line of sight to the astronomical target. These systems can be enhanced with data from an external atmospheric proﬁler. This is important for Extremely Large Telescope scale tomography. Here we propose a new instrument which utilises the generalised SCIntillation Detection And Ranging (SCIDAR) technique to allow high sensitivity vertical proﬁles of the atmospheric optical turbulence and wind velocity proﬁle above astronomical observatories. The new approach, which we refer to as ‘Stereo–SCIDAR’, uses a stereoscopic system with the scintillation pattern from each star of a double-star target incident on a separate detector. Separating the pupil images for each star has several advantages including: increased magnitude diﬀerence tolerance for the target stars; negating the need for re-calibration due to the normalisation errors usually associated with SCIDAR; an increase of at least a factor of two in the signal-to-noise ratio of the cross–covariance function and hence the proﬁle for equal magnitude target stars and up to a factor of 16 improvement for targets of 3 magnitudes diﬀerence; and easier real-time reconstruction of the wind-velocity proﬁle. Theoretical response functions are calculated for the instrument, and the performance is investigated using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The technique is demonstrated using data recorded at the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope and the 1.0 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope, both on La Palma.},

NMF is an iterative approach, which ﬁrst creates a non-orthogonal and non-negative basis of components using given reference images, then models a target with the components. The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from a disk. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference di↵erential imaging method, and the Karhunen-Lo`eve image projection algorithm) using synthetic circumstellar disks, and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need for prior selection of references, NMF can detect fainter circumstellar disks, better preserve low order disk morphology, and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) STIS coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with di↵erent methods and compare them. NMF is able to extract some circumstellar material inside the primary ring for the ﬁrst time.

	abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of speci®c applications. However, in any speci®c application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the speci®c context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of ®tting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc ®tting, and after calibration the model is used, with the ®tted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the ®tted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-®tting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

	abstract = {We investigate the ellipticity of the point-spread function (PSF) produced by imaging an unresolved source with a telescope, subject to the effects of atmospheric turbulence. It is important to quantify these effects in order to understand the errors in shape measurements of astronomical objects, such as those used to study weak gravitational lensing of field galaxies. The PSF modeling involves either a Fourier transform of the phase information in the pupil plane or a ray-tracing approach, which has the advantage of requiring fewer computations than the Fourier transform. Using a standard method, involving the Gaussian weighted second moments of intensity, we then calculate the ellipticity of the PSF patterns. We find significant ellipticity for the instantaneous patterns (up to more than 10\%). Longer exposures, which we approximate by combining multiple (N) images from uncorrelated atmospheric realizations, yield progressively lower ellipticity (as 1 / sqrt(N)). We also verify that the measured ellipticity does not depend on the sampling interval in the pupil plane using the Fourier method. However, we find that the results using the ray-tracing technique do depend on the pupil sampling interval, representing a gradual breakdown of the geometric approximation at high spatial frequencies. Therefore, ray tracing is generally not an accurate method of modeling PSF ellipticity induced by atmospheric turbulence unless some additional procedure is implemented to correctly account for the effects of high spatial frequency aberrations. The Fourier method, however, can be used directly to accurately model PSF ellipticity, which can give insights into errors in the statistics of field galaxy shapes used in studies of weak gravitational lensing.},

Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n = 251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments. Our results highlight how understanding the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in STEM requires examining both racial and gender biases as well as how they intersect.},

This paper presents a generic version of the Feature-Based scheduler, with minimal manual tailoring, to demonstrate its potential and ﬂexibility as a foundation for large ground-based telescope schedulers which can later be adjusted for other instruments.

The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics. As a result, for astrophysical applications, a clear recommendation has emerged: the Landy \& Szalay estimator, in its original or grid version (Szapudi \& Szalay), is preferred in comparison with the other indicators examined, with a performance almost indistinguishable from the Hamilton estimator.},
