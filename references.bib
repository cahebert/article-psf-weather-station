	abstract = {We describe the simulated sky survey underlying the second data challenge (DC2) carried out in preparation for analysis of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC). Signiﬁcant connections across multiple science domains will be a hallmark of LSST; the DC2 program represents a unique modeling effort that stresses this interconnectivity in a way that has not been attempted before. This effort encompasses a full end-to-end approach: starting from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations including realistic cadences, through image simulations, and ﬁnally processing with Rubin’s LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate data products resembling those to be delivered by the Rubin Observatory as closely as is currently possible. The simulated DC2 sky survey covers six optical bands in a wide-fast-deep (WFD) area of approximately 300 deg2 as well as a deep drilling ﬁeld (DDF) of approximately 1 deg2. We simulate 5 years of the planned 10-year survey. The DC2 sky survey has multiple purposes. First, the LSST DESC working groups can use the dataset to develop a range of DESC analysis pipelines to prepare for the advent of actual data. Second, it serves as a realistic testbed for the image processing software under development for LSST by the Rubin Observatory. In particular, simulated data provide a controlled way to investigate certain image-level systematic effects. Finally, the DC2 sky survey enables the exploration of new scientiﬁc ideas in both static and time-domain cosmology.},

	volume = {00},
	abstract = {We present and characterize the catalog of galaxy shape measurements that will be used for cosmological weak lensing measurements in the Wide layer of the ﬁrst year of the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The catalog covers an area of 136.9 deg2 split into six ﬁelds, with a mean i-band seeing of 0.58′′ and 5σ point-source depth of i ∼ 26. Given conservative galaxy selection criteria for ﬁrst year science, the depth and excellent image quality results in unweighted and weighted source number densities of 24.6 and 21.8 arcmin−2, respectively. We deﬁne the requirements for cosmological weak lensing science with this catalog, then focus on characterizing potential systematics in the catalog using a series of internal null tests for problems with point-spread function (PSF) modeling, shear estimation, and other aspects of the image processing. We ﬁnd that the PSF models narrowly meet requirements for weak lensing science with this catalog, with fractional PSF model size residuals of approximately 0.003 (requirement: 0.004) and the PSF model shape correlation function ρ1 {\textless} 3 × 10−7 (requirement: 4 × 10−7) at 0.5◦ scales. A variety of galaxy shape-related null tests are statistically consistent with zero, but star-galaxy shape correlations reveal additive systematics on on {\textgreater} 1◦ scales that are sufﬁciently large as to require mitigation in cosmic shear measurements. Finally, we discuss the dominant systematics and the planned algorithmic changes to reduce them in future data reductions.},

	abstract = {In this study, we interpret two vertical turbulence measurements. We acquired these uninterrupted high-resolution dissipation rate profiles with the balloon-borne instrument LITOS (Leibniz Institute Turbulence Observations in the Stratosphere) from velocity measurements using a spectral technique. The meteorological situation is characterized using ECMWF’s integrated forecast system (IFS) as breaking Rossby waves showing significant tropospheric jets and a developed tropopause fold. In both cases, dissipation rates in the shear zone above the upper-tropospheric jet are three orders of magnitude larger than below, reaching severe turbulence strengths (1,000 mW kg−1) in a deep tropopause fold and moderate turbulence strengths in a medium tropopause fold (10 mW kg−1). These turbulent spots are shown to create a tripole shaped pattern of PV modification across the tropopause. Furthermore, tracertracer correlations exhibit mixing of tropospheric and stratospheric air masses in the medium-fold case. While the strength of turbulence corresponds to the depth of the tropopause fold, its asymmetric vertical distribution is possibly related to the tropopause fold life cycle. The observed asymmetry in the vertical turbulence distribution is consistent across both tropopause folds and in overall agreement with measured Richardson numbers. In the medium-fold case however, it is neither expected from conceptual models nor from Richardson numbers in the IFS. This calls for further field campaigns to investigate the role of turbulence and its implications for the meteorological understanding as well as for aviation safety.},

Since the absorption length of silicon depends on wavelength, CCDs are a potential source of PSF chromaticity. Here we develop two toy models to estimate the sensitivity of the cosmic shear survey from the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope to chromatic effects in CCDs. We then compare these toy models to simulated estimates of PSF chromaticity derived from the LSST photon simulator PHOSIM. We ﬁnd that even though sensor contributions to PSF chromaticity are subdominant to atmospheric contributions, they can still signiﬁcantly bias cosmic shear results if left uncorrected, particularly in the redder ﬁlter bands and for objects that are off-axis in the ﬁeld of view.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11892},
	abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful statistical tool for probing the growth of cosmic structure and measuring cosmological parameters. However, as shown by studies such as M´enard et al. (2010), dust in the circumgalactic region of haloes dims and reddens background sources. In a weak lensing analysis, this selects against sources behind overdense regions; since there is more structure in overdense regions, we will underestimate the amplitude of density perturbations σ8 if we do not correct for the eﬀects of circumgalactic dust. To model the dust distribution we employ the halo model. Assuming a ﬁducial dust mass proﬁle based on measurements from M´enard et al. (2010), we compute the ratio Z of the systematic error to the statistical error for a survey similar to the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope reference survey (2000 deg2 area, single-ﬁlter eﬀective source density 30 galaxies arcmin−2). For a waveband centered at 1580 nm (H-band), we ﬁnd that ZH = 0.37. For a similar survey with waveband centered at 620 nm (r-band), we also computed Zr = 2.8. Within our ﬁducial dust model, since Zr {\textgreater} 1, the systematic eﬀect of dust will be signiﬁcant on weak lensing image surveys. We also computed the dust bias on the amplitude of the power spectrum, σ8, and found it to be for each waveband ∆σ8/σ8 = −3.1 × 10−4 (H band) or −2.2 × 10−3 (r band) if all other parameters are held ﬁxed (the forecast Roman statistical-only error σ(σ8)/σ8 is 9 × 10−4).},

	abstract = {We develop and test a method for measuring the gravitational lensing induced distortion of faint background galaxies. We ﬁrst describe how we locate the galaxies and measure a 2-component ‘polarisation’ or ellipticity statistic eα whose expectation value should be proportional to the gravitational shear γα. We then show that an anisotropic instrumental psf perturbs the polarisation by δeα = Pαsβ pβ, where pα is a measure of the psf anisotropy and Pαsβ is the ‘linearised smear polarisability tensor’. By estimating Pαsβ for each object we can determine pα from the foreground stars and apply a correction −Pαsβpβ to the galaxies. We test this procedure using deep high-resolution images from HST which are smeared with an anisotropic psf and then have noise added to simulate ground-based observations. We ﬁnd that the procedure works very well. A similar analysis yields a linear shear polarisability tensor Pαγβ which describes the response to a gravitational shear. This calibrates the polarisation-shear relation, but only for galaxies which are well resolved. To empirically calibrate the eﬀect of seeing on the smaller galaxies we artiﬁcially stretch HST images to simulate lensing and then degrade them as before. These experiments provide a rigorous and exacting test of the method under realistic conditions. They show that it is possible to remove the eﬀect of instrumental psf anisotropy, and that the method provides an eﬃcient and quantitative measurement of the gravitational shear.},

	abstract = {When simulating sky images, one often takes a galaxy image F (x) deﬁned by a set of pixelized samples and an interpolation kernel, and then wants to produce a new sampled image representing this galaxy as it would appear with a diﬀerent point-spread function, a rotation, shearing, or magniﬁcation, and/or a diﬀerent pixel scale. These operations are sometimes only possible, or most eﬃciently executed, as resamplings of the Fourier transform F˜(u) of the image onto a u-space grid that diﬀers from the one produced by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the samples. In some applications it is essential that the resampled image be accurate to better than 1 part in 103, so in this paper we ﬁrst use standard Fourier techniques to show that Fourier-domain interpolation with a wrapped sinc function yields the exact value of F˜(u) in terms of the input samples and kernel. This operation scales with image dimension as N 4 and can be prohibitively slow, so we next investigate the errors accrued from approximating the sinc function with a compact kernel. We show that these approximations produce a multiplicative error plus a pair of ghost images (in each dimension) in the simulated image. Standard Lanczos or cubic interpolators, when applied in Fourier domain, produce unacceptable artifacts. We ﬁnd that errors {\textless} 1 part in 103 can be obtained by (1) 4-fold zero-padding of the original image before executing the x → u DFT, followed by (2) resampling to the desired u grid using a 6-point, piecewise-quintic interpolant that we design expressly to minimize the ghosts, then (3) executing the DFT back to x domain.},

The most successful methods are shown to achieve percent level accuracy. From the cosmic shear pipelines that have been used to constrain cosmology, we ﬁnd weak lensing shear measured to an accuracy that is within the statistical errors of current weak lensing analyses, with shear measurements accurate to better than 7\%. The dominant source of measurement error is shown to arise from calibration uncertainties where the measured shear is over or under-estimated by a constant multiplicative factor. This is of concern as calibration errors cannot be detected through standard diagnostic tests. The measured calibration errors appear to result from stellar contamination, false object detection, the shear measurement method itself, selection bias and/or the use of biased weights. Additive systematics (false detections of shear) resulting from residual point-spread function anisotropy are, in most cases, reduced to below an equivalent shear of 0.001, an order of magnitude below cosmic shear distortions on the scales probed by current surveys.},

Those reductions using Gaussian process interpolation are similar to recent result published with the Dark Energy Survey dataset.

	abstract = {Adaptive optics (AO) systems that use tomographic estimation of the three-dimensional structure of atmospheric turbulence require the vertical atmospheric turbulence proﬁle, which describes turbulence strength as a function of altitude as prior information. We propose a novel method to reconstruct the proﬁle by applying a multi-aperture scintillation sensor (MASS) method to scintillation data obtained by a Shack–Hartmann wavefront sensor (SH-WFS). Compared with a traditional MASS, which uses atmospheric scintillation within four concentric annular apertures, the new method utilizes scintillation in several hundreds of spatial patterns, which are created by combinations of SH-WFS subapertures. Accuracy of the turbulence proﬁle reconstruction is evaluated with Bayesian inference, and it is conﬁrmed that the turbulence proﬁle with more than 10 layers can be reconstructed because of the large number of constraints. We demonstrate the new method with a SH-WFS attached to the 51-cm telescope at Tohoku University and we conﬁrm that the general characteristics of the atmospheric turbulence proﬁle are reproduced.},

We aim to estimate the vertical distribution of the wavefront outer scale. We analyse the angular correlation of the ﬂuctuations of the wavefront angle of arrival, deduced from image motion of the limb of the Moon. We use a simulated annealing algorithm to deduce the height dependence of the wavefront outer scale with given C2N proﬁles simultaneously measured with the scintillation detection and ranging (SCIDAR) instrument. We present results obtained during two campaigns of observation at the Mauna Kea Observatory (Hawaii) and the Observatoire de Haute Provence (France).

	abstract = {We describe an online method to estimate the wavefront outer scale proﬁle, L0(h), for very large and future extremely large telescopes. The stratiﬁed information on this parameter impacts the estimation of the main turbulence parameters [turbulence strength, Cn2(h); Fried’s parameter, r0; isoplanatic angle, θ 0; and coherence time, τ 0) and determines the performance of wideﬁeld adaptive optics (AO) systems. This technique estimates L0(h) using data from the AO loop available at the facility instruments by constructing the cross-correlation functions of the slopes between two or more wavefront sensors, which are later ﬁtted to a linear combination of the simulated theoretical layers having different altitudes and outer scale values. We analyse some limitations found in the estimation process: (i) its insensitivity to large values of L0(h) as the telescope becomes blind to outer scales larger than its diameter; (ii) the maximum number of observable layers given the limited number of independent inputs that the cross-correlation functions provide and (iii) the minimum length of data required for a satisfactory convergence of the turbulence parameters without breaking the assumption of statistical stationarity of the turbulence. The method is applied to the Gemini South multiconjugate AO system that comprises ﬁve wavefront sensors and two deformable mirrors. Statistics of L0(h) at Cerro Pacho´n from data acquired during 3 yr of campaigns show interesting resemblance to other independent results in the literature. A ﬁnal analysis suggests that the impact of error sources will be substantially reduced in instruments of the next generation of giant telescopes.},

This yields the desired coherence function in terms of the statistics of the random fluctuations of the atmospheric index of refraction.

It is especially crucial for weak gravitational lensing, in order to beat down systematics and allow one to reach the full potential of weak lensing in measuring dark energy. A PSF modelling pipeline is made of two main steps: the ﬁrst one is to assess its shape on stars, and the second is to interpolate it at any desired position (usually galaxies). We focus on the second part, and compare different interpolation schemes, including polynomial interpolation, radial basis functions, Delaunay triangulation and Kriging. For that purpose, we develop simulations of PSF ﬁelds, in which stars are built from a set of basis functions deﬁned from a principal components analysis of a real ground-based image. We ﬁnd that Kriging gives the most reliable interpolation, signiﬁcantly better than the traditionally used polynomial interpolation. We also note that although a Kriging interpolation on individual images is enough to control systematics at the level necessary for current weak lensing surveys, more elaborate techniques will have to be developed to reach future ambitious surveys’ requirements.},

The description is focused upon the speciﬁc problem of modelling the spatial variation of a telescope point spread function (PSF) across the instrument ﬁeld of view, a crucial stage in lensing data analysis, but the technique may be used to rank competing models wherever data are described empirically. As such it may, with further development, provide useful extra information when used in combination with existing model selection techniques such as the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, or the Bayesian evidence. Two independent diagnostic correlation functions are described, and the interpretation of these functions is demonstrated by using a simulated PSF anisotropy ﬁeld. The efﬁcacy of these diagnostic functions as an aid to the correct choice of empirical model is then demonstrated by analysing results for a suite of Monte Carlo simulations of random PSF ﬁelds with varying degrees of spatial structure, and it is shown how the diagnostic functions can be related to requirements for precision cosmic shear measurement. The limitations of the technique, and opportunities for improvements and applications to ﬁelds other than weak gravitational lensing, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Methods. We study the eﬀects at the focus of a telescope of ﬁnite turbulence outer scale and partial adaptive corrections, both corresponding to a reduction in the low-frequency content of the phase perturbation spectrum, by means of analytical calculations and numerical simulations.
Results. If a von Kàrmàn turbulence model is adopted, a simple approximate formula predicts the dependence of atmospheric longexposure resolution on the outer scale over the entire practically interesting range of telescope diameters and wavelengths. In the infrared (IR), the diﬀerence from the standard Kolmogorov seeing formula can exceed a factor of two. We ﬁnd that a low-order adaptive turbulence correction produces residual wavefronts eﬀectively of small outer scale, so even a very low compensation order leads to a substantial improvement in resolution over seeing, compared to the standard theory.
Conclusions. Seeing-limited resolution of large telescopes, especially in the IR, is currently under estimated by not accounting for the outer scale. On the other hand, adaptive-optics systems optimized for diﬀraction-limited imaging in the IR can improve the resolution in the visible by as much as a factor of two.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive methodology for the simulation of astronomical images from optical survey telescopes. We use a photon Monte Carlo approach to construct images by sampling photons from models of astronomical source populations, and then simulating those photons through the system as they interact with the atmosphere, telescope, and camera. We demonstrate that all physical eﬀects for optical light that determine the shapes, locations, and brightnesses of individual stars and galaxies can be accurately represented in this formalism. By using large scale grid computing, modern processors, and an eﬃcient implementation that can produce 400,000 photons/second, we demonstrate that even very large optical surveys can be now be simulated. We demonstrate that we are able to: 1) construct kilometer scale phase screens necessary for wide-ﬁeld telescopes, 2) reproduce atmospheric point-spread-function moments using a fast novel hybrid geometric/Fourier technique for non-diﬀraction limited telescopes, 3) accurately reproduce the expected spot diagrams for complex aspheric optical designs, and 4) recover system eﬀective area predicted from analytic photometry integrals. This new code, the photon simulator (PhoSim), is publicly available. We have implemented the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) design, and it can be extended to other telescopes. We expect that because of the comprehensive physics implemented in PhoSim, it will be used by the community to plan future observations, interpret detailed existing observations, and quantify systematics related to various astronomical measurements. Future development and validation by comparisons with real data will continue to improve the ﬁdelity and usability of the code.},

	abstract = {A main science goal for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is to measure the cosmic shear signal from weak lensing to extreme accuracy. One difﬁculty, however, is that with the short exposure time ( 15 s) proposed, the spatial variation of the point spread function (PSF) shapes may be dominated by the atmosphere, in addition to optics errors. While optics errors mainly cause the PSF to vary on angular scales similar or larger than a single CCD sensor, the atmosphere generates stochastic structures on a wide range of angular scales. It thus becomes a challenge to infer the multiscale, complex atmospheric PSF patterns by interpolating the sparsely sampled stars in the ﬁeld. In this paper we present a new method, PSFENT, for interpolating the PSF shape parameters, based on reconstructing underlying shape parameter maps with a multiscale maximum entropy algorithm. We demonstrate, using images from the LSST Photon Simulator, the performance of our approach relative to a ﬁfth-order polynomial ﬁt (representing the current standard) and a simple boxcar smoothing technique. Quantitatively, PSFENT predicts more accurate PSF models in all scenarios and the residual PSF errors are spatially less correlated. This improvement in PSF interpolation leads to a factor of 3.5 lower systematic errors in the shear power spectrum on scales smaller than ∼13 arcmin, compared to polynomial ﬁtting. We estimate that with PSFENT and for stellar densities greater than 1 arcmin−2, the spurious shear correlation from PSF interpolation, after combining a complete 10-yr data set from LSST, is lower than the corresponding statistical uncertainties on the cosmic shear power spectrum, even under a conservative scenario.},

	abstract = {For ground-based optical imaging with current CCD technology, the Poisson ﬂuctuations in source and sky background photon arrivals dominate the noise budget and are readily estimated. Another component of noise, however, is the signal from the undetected population of stars and galaxies. Using injection of artiﬁcal galaxies into images, we demonstrate that the measured variance of galaxy moments (used for weak gravitational lensing measurements) in Dark Energy Survey (DES) images is signiﬁcantly in excess of the Poisson predictions, by up to 30\%, and that the background sky levels are overestimated by current software. By cross-correlating distinct images of “empty” sky regions, we establish that there is a signiﬁcant image noise contribution from undetected static sources (US), which on average are mildly resolved at DES resolution. Treating these US as a stationary noise source, we compute a correction to the moment covariance matrix expected from Poisson noise. The corrected covariance matrix matches the moment variances measured on the injected DES images to within 5\%. Thus we have an empirical method to statistically account for US in weak lensing measurements, rather than requiring extremely deep sky simulations. We also ﬁnd that local sky determinations can remove the bias in ﬂux measurements, at a small penalty in additional, but quantiﬁable, noise.},

Typically, the layers are ∼15–130 m thick and have a distance of ∼60–270 m, and their number increases with altitude. Due to the very high measurement resolution of LITOS in the range of millimeters, we obtain energy dissipation rate proﬁles with unprecedented precision. Within the turbulent layers we get a mean dissipation rate of 3.4×10−2 W/kg (BEXUS 6) and 1.1×10−2 W/kg (BEXUS 8) corresponding to a heating rate of 1 to ∼3 K/d. The proﬁles show an increase of the energy dissipation with altitude. Comparisons with the Richardson number Ri preclude a clear correlation between the occurrence of turbulence and Ri {\textless}1∕4. Despite the expected occurrence of turbulence at Ri {\textless} 1/4, we also observed turbulent layers where Ri was {\textgreater}1∕4 and far beyond, independent of the scale over which Ri has been determined.},

	abstract = {The complexity of computing conventional matrix multiply wave-front reconstructors scales as O(n3) for most adaptive optical (AO) systems, where n is the number of deformable mirror (DM) actuators. This is impractical for proposed systems with extremely large n. It is known that sparse matrix methods improve this scaling for least-squares reconstructors, but sparse techniques are not immediately applicable to the minimum-variance reconstructors now favored for multiconjugate adaptive optical (MCAO) systems with multiple wave-front sensors (WFSs) and DMs. Complications arise from the nonsparse statistics of atmospheric turbulence, and the global tip/tilt WFS measurement errors associated with laser guide star (LGS) position uncertainty. A description is given of how sparse matrix methods can still be applied by use of a sparse approximation for turbulence statistics and by recognizing that the nonsparse matrix terms arising from LGS position uncertainty are low-rank adjustments that can be evaluated by using the matrix inversion lemma. Sample numerical results for AO and MCAO systems illustrate that the approximation made to turbulence statistics has negligible effect on estimation accuracy, the time to compute the sparse minimum-variance reconstructor for a conventional natural guide star AO system scales as O(n3/2) and is only a few seconds for n=3500, and sparse techniques reduce the reconstructor computations by a factor of 8 for sample MCAO systems with 2417 DM actuators and 4280 WFS subapertures. With extrapolation to 9700 actuators and 17,120 subapertures, a reduction by a factor of approximately 30 or 40 to 1 is predicted.},

The catalog is based on a trillion-particle, (4.225 Gpc)3 box cosmological N-body simulation, the Outer Rim run. It covers 440deg2 of sky area to a redshift of z=3 and matches expected number densities from contemporary surveys to a magnitude depth of 28 in the r band. Each galaxy is characterized by a multitude of galaxy properties including stellar mass, morphology, spectral energy distributions, broadband ﬁlter magnitudes, host halo information, and weak lensing shear. The size and complexity of cosmoDC2 requires an efﬁcient catalog generation methodology; our approach is based on a new hybrid technique that combines data-based empirical approaches with semianalytic galaxy modeling. A wide range of observation-based validation tests has been implemented to ensure that cosmoDC2 enables the science goals of the planned LSSTDESC DC2 analyses.

The computation of the resulting bias in the shear power spectrum scales as the ﬁfth power of the maximum multipole considered. Consequently the calculation is unfeasible for large ℓ-modes, and the only tractable way to assess the full impact of shape measurement biases on cosmic shear power spectrum is through forward modelling of the eﬀects. To linear order in bias parameters the shear power spectrum is only aﬀected by the mean of the multiplicative bias ﬁeld over a survey and the cross correlation between the additive bias ﬁeld and the shear ﬁeld.

Daytime surface wind speeds are shown to be broadly consistent with the Weibull distribution, while nighttime surface wind speeds are generally more positively skewed than the corresponding Weibull distribution (particularly in summer). In the midlatitudes, these strongly positive skewnesses are shown to be generally associated with conditions of strong surface stability and weak lower-tropospheric wind shear. Long-term tower observations from Cabauw, the Netherlands, and Los Alamos, New Mexico, demonstrate that lower-tropospheric wind speeds become more positively skewed than the corresponding Weibull distribution only in the shallow (;50 m) nocturnal boundary layer. This skewness is associated with two populations of nighttime winds: (i) strongly stably stratiﬁed with strong wind shear and (ii) weakly stably or unstably stratiﬁed with weak wind shear. Using an idealized two-layer model of the boundary layer momentum budget, it is shown that the observed variability of the daytime and nighttime surface wind speeds can be accounted for through a stochastic representation of intermittent turbulent mixing at the nocturnal boundary layer inversion.},

	abstract = {The results of a three-month continuous monitoring of the turbulence proﬁle and seeing at Cerro Tololo (Chile) in 2002 May–July are presented. Some 28 000 low-resolution proﬁles were measured by a new MASS single-star turbulence monitor, accompanied by seeing data from DIMM. The median seeing was 0.95 arcsec. The ﬁrst 500 m contribute 60 per cent to the total seeing, and the free-atmosphere median seeing was 0.55 arcsec. The free-atmosphere seeing is almost never better than 0.15 arcsec because there is always some turbulence above 12 km. A 4-d period of calm upper atmosphere with a stable free-atmosphere seeing of 0.2–0.3 arcsec was noted. The gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of the ground layer will be typically 1.7 times, and 2–3 times during such calm periods. Correlations of the freeatmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at the tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with the ground wind are studied. The temporal evolution of turbulence is characterized by recurrent bursts, their typical duration increasing from 15 min in low layers to 1–2 h in high layers. The large data base of turbulence proﬁles can be used to test mesoscale modelling of astronomical seeing.},

These works aimed at validating the atmospheric model Meso-Nh which was conceived to simulate classical atmospheric parameters and was then adapted to simulate optical turbulence (3D maps of CN2 ). Good results were obtained but further improvements can be made. One of the principal limitations is the statistical reliability of the model that is, at the present time, not very high. In this paper we present some modiﬁcations introduced in the optical turbulence parameterization of the model that aim to reduce some systematic errors. Preliminary results, obtained comparing the simulations with measurements taken at the San Pedro M´artir site (Mexico) in March–April 1997, show that we are now able to obtain a better qualitative and quantitative estimate of the CN2 proﬁles. Finally, we show how we have been able to improve the spatiotemporal variability of the model.},

It can also be used to simulate long-term site testing to provide local information useful for the conception of focal and post-focal instrumentation. We have presented our forecasting tool in previous publications, but in this paper we focus on the importance of using local measurements to improve the predictive turbulence model and to better consider the local speciﬁcities of a given site, a process we call site learning. For this study, we use a local data base provided by the Calern Atmospheric Turbulence Station, which has been operational since 2015 at Calern Observatory. In addition, we use a set of several months of predictions to feed the turbulence model, taking into account daytime and nighttime conditions. This upgrade improves the quality of our forecasting by reducing the absolute bias between measurements and predictions from 25 to 50 per cent for each layer of the Cn2, by 25 per cent for the seeing, and by 70 per cent for the isoplanatic angle.},

In this study, we perform retrospective simulations of optical turbulence over the Hawaiian islands using a mesoscale model. The simulated results are validated against thermosonde data. We focus on turbulence in the free atmosphere, above the atmospheric boundary layer. The free atmosphere is particularly important for adaptive optics performance and for sky coverage calculations and hence has signiﬁcant impact on performance optimization and scheduling of observations. We demonstrate that a vertical grid spacing of 100 m or ﬁner is needed to faithfully capture the intrinsic variabilities of observed clear air turbulence. This is a particularly timely study because the next generation of extremely large telescopes are currently under construction and their associated suite of instruments are in the design phase. Knowledge of the expected accuracy of optical turbulence simulations and real-time forecasts will enable the design teams to (i) test and develop instrument designs and (ii) formulate operational procedure.},

Previsions are obtained with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in combination with the Trinquet–Vernin (TV) model, which allows us to compute the optical turbulence from the vertical gradient of the temperature and the wind velocity. The ﬁrst aim of this study is to demonstrate the ability of the WRF model to reproduce the spatial evolution of the weather and especially the optical conditions, even using low-resolution input data. The second purpose is the deﬁnition of a quality parameter Q, which can be used to determine and discriminate between astronomical sites. More than 4500 h of simulations were calculated in 2009 and we present an average of these predictions over a 2D grid. The results show that the WRF model is able to simulate the spatial evolution of the weather at a better resolution than the coarse input data and it adapts the dynamic ﬂow to the terrain orography. The quality parameter is applied to the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos at La Palma and shows that it is, within 2 km precision, installed at the best possible location on the island.},

Here we compare these astro-meteorological parameters as well as the vertical proﬁle itself from a forecast model based on a General Circulation Model from the European Centre for Median range Weather Forecasts and the stereo-SCIDAR, a highsensitivity turbulence proﬁling instrument in regular operation at Paranal, Chile. The model is fast to process as no spatial nesting or data manipulation is performed. This speed enables the model to be reactive based on the most up to date forecasts. We ﬁnd that the model is statistically consistent with measurements from stereo-SCIDAR. The correlation of the median turbulence proﬁle from the model and the measurement is 0.98. We also ﬁnd that the distributions of astro-meteorological parameters are consistent. We compare contemporaneous measurements and show that the free atmosphere seeing, isoplanatic angle and coherence time have correlation values of 0.64, 0.40 and 0.63 respectively. We show and compare the proﬁle sequences from a large number of trial nights. We see that the model is able to forecast the evolution of dominating features. In addition to smart scheduling, ensuring that the most sensitive astronomical observations are scheduled for the optimum time, this model could enable remote site characterisation using a large archive of weather forecasts and could be used to optimise the performance of wide-ﬁeld AO system.},

We present an exact expression for the number of galaxy pairs in this term based on the survey mask, which leads to more than a factor of three increase in the shape noise on the largest measured scales for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KIDS-450) real-space cosmic shear data. We compare the result of this analytic expression to several alternative methods for measuring the shape noise from the data and ﬁnd excellent agreement. This update to the covariance resolves any internal model tension evidenced by the previously large cosmological best-ﬁt χ2 for the KiDS-450 cosmic shear data. The best-ﬁt χ2 is reduced from 161 to 121 for 118 degrees of freedom. We also apply a correction to how the multiplicative shear calibration uncertainty is included in the covariance. This change shifts the inferred amplitude of the correlation function to higher values. We ﬁnd that this improves agreement of the KiDS-450 cosmic shear results with Dark Energy Survey Year 1 and Planck results.},

The velocity of atmospheric optical turbulence is an important parameter for several applications including astronomical adaptive optics systems. Here, we compare the vertical proﬁle of the velocity of the atmospheric wind above La Palma by means of a comparison of Stereo-SCIntillation Detection And Ranging (StereoSCIDAR) with the Global Forecast System models and nearby balloon-borne radiosondes. We use these data to validate the automated optical turbulence velocity identiﬁcation from the Stereo-SCIDAR instrument mounted on the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope, La Palma. By comparing these data we infer that the turbulence velocity and the wind velocity are consistent and that the automated turbulence velocity identiﬁcation of the Stereo-SCIDAR is precise. The turbulence velocities can be used to increase the sensitivity of the turbulence strength proﬁles, as weaker turbulence that may be misinterpreted as noise can be detected with a velocity vector. The turbulence velocities can also be used to increase the altitude resolution of a detected layer, as the altitude of the velocity vectors can be identiﬁed to a greater precision than the native resolution of the system. We also show examples of complex velocity structure within a turbulent layer caused by wind shear at the interface of atmospheric zones.},

We analyse dense stellar ﬁelds imaged at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to quantify the degree of high spatial frequency variation in ground-based imaging Point Spread Functions and compare our results to models of atmospheric turbulence. The data shows an anisotropic turbulence pattern with an orientation independent of the wind direction and wind speed. We ﬁnd the amplitude of the high spatial frequencies to decrease with increasing exposure time as t−1/2, and ﬁnd a negligibly small atmospheric contribution to the Point Spread Function ellipticity variation for exposure times t {\textgreater} 180 seconds. For future surveys analysing shorter exposure data, this anisotropic turbulence will need to be taken into account as the amplitude of the correlated atmospheric distortions becomes comparable to a cosmological lensing signal on scales less than ∼ 10 arcminutes. This effect could be mitigated, however, by correlating galaxy shear measured on exposures imaged with a time separation greater than 50 seconds, for which we ﬁnd the spatial turbulence patterns to be uncorrelated.},

	abstract = {We present the source separation framework scarlet for multi-band images, which is based on a generalization of the Non-negative Matrix Factorization to alternative and several simultaneous constraints. Our approach describes the observed scene as a mixture of components with compact spatial support and uniform spectra over their support. We present the algorithm to perform the matrix factorization and introduce constraints that are useful for optical images of stars and distinct stellar populations in galaxies, in particular symmetry and monotonicity with respect to the source peak position. We also derive the treatment of correlated noise and convolutions with band-dependent point spread functions, rendering our approach applicable to coadded images observed under variable seeing conditions. scarlet thus yields a PSF-matched photometry measurement with an optimally chosen weight function given by the mean morphology in all available bands. We demonstrate the performance of scarlet for deblending crowded extragalactic scenes and on an AGN jet – host galaxy separation problem in deep 5-band imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Stategic Survey Program. Using simulations with prominent crowding we show that scarlet yields superior results to the HSCSDSS deblender for the recovery of total ﬂuxes, colors, and morphologies. Due to its non-parametric nature, a conceptual limitation of scarlet is its sensitivity to undetected sources or multiple stellar population within detected sources, but an iterative strategy that adds components at the location of signiﬁcant residuals appears promising.

The method implied the use of a dedicated code conceived for the OT called ASTRO-MESO-NH. In this paper, we present results we obtained at conclusion of this project concerning the performances of this method in forecasting the most relevant parameters related to the OT (CN2 , seeing ε, isoplanatic angle θ 0 and wavefront coherence time τ 0). Numerical predictions related to a very rich statistical sample of nights uniformly distributed along a solar year and belonging to different years have been compared to observations, and different statistical operators have been analysed such as the classical bias, root-mean-squared error, σ and more sophisticated statistical operators derived by the contingency tables that are able to quantify the score of success of a predictive method such as the percentage of correct detection (PC) and the probability to detect a parameter within a speciﬁc range of values (POD). The main conclusions of the study tell us that the ASTRO-MESO-NH model provides performances that are already very good to deﬁnitely guarantee a not negligible positive impact on the service mode of top-class telescopes and ELTs. A demonstrator for an automatic and operational version of the ASTRO-MESO-NH model will be soon implemented on the sites of VLT and E-ELT.},

The method involves distorting the image with a small known shear, and calculating the response of a shear estimator to that applied shear. The method was shown to be accurate in moderate-sized simulations with galaxy images that hadrelatively high signal-to-noise ratios, and without signiﬁcant selection effects. In this work we introduce a formalism to correct for both shear response and selection biases. We also observe thatfor images withrelatively low signal-to-noise ratios, the correlated noise that arises during the METACALIBRATION process results in signiﬁcant bias, for which we develop a simple empirical correction. To test this formalism, we created large image simulations based on both parametric models and real galaxy images, including tests with realistic point-spread functions. We varied the point-spread function ellipticity at the ﬁve-percent level. In each simulation we applied a smallfew-percent shear to the galaxy images. We introduced additional challenges that arise in real data, such as detection thresholds, stellar contamination, and missing data. We applied cuts on the measured galaxy properties to induce signiﬁcant selection effects. Using our formalism, we recovered the input shear with an accuracy better than a part in a thousand in all cases.},

We investigate how pixel noise on the image affects the bias on shear estimates from a maximum likelihood forward model-ﬁtting approach using a sum of co-elliptical Se´rsic proﬁles, in complement to the theoretical approach of an associated paper. We evaluate the bias using a simple but realistic galaxy model and ﬁnd that the effects of noise alone can cause biases of the order of 1–10 per cent on measured shears, which is signiﬁcant for current and future lensing surveys. We evaluate a simulation-based calibration method to create a bias model as a function of galaxy properties and observing conditions. This model is then used to correct the simulated measurements. We demonstrate that, for the simple case in which the correct range of galaxy models is used in the ﬁt, the calibration method can reduce noise bias to the level required for estimating cosmic shear in upcoming lensing surveys.},

For future large surveys, shot noise will be so low that other, systematic errors will likely dominate. Here we examine a potential source of additive systematic error for ground-based observations: spurious power induced by the atmosphere.

In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs –extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacriﬁcing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout’s uncertainty. Various network architectures and nonlinearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classiﬁcation, using MNIST as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and ﬁnish by using dropout’s uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

An image’s spin one and three shape properties, typically associated with F - and G-flexion, are actually complicated functions of the galaxy’s intrinsic shape and the telescope’s PSF, in addition to the lensing properties. The same is true for shear. In this work we create a completely analytic mapping from apparent measured galaxy flexions to gravitational flexions by (1) creating simple models for a lensed galaxy and for a PSF whose distortions are dominated by atmospheric smearing and optical aberrations, (2) convolving the two models, and (3) comparing the pre- and post-convolved flexionlike shape variations of the final image. For completeness, we do the same for shear. As expected, telescope astigmatism, coma, and trefoil can corrupt measurements of shear, F -flexion, and G-flexion, especially for small galaxies. We additionally find that PSF size dilutes the flexion signal more rapidly than the shear signal. Moreover, mixing between shears, flexions, and asymmetric aberrations can create additive offsets in lensing measurements that vary with both galaxy size and galaxy ellipticity and flexion values. But all is not lost; by measuring the patterns, we can correct for them.},

In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

The contribution of CCD readout noise to image motion variance is modeled. It can substantially bias DIMM results if left unsubtracted.

This effect is studied quantitatively for real turbulence and wind proﬁles, and its correction by interlaced short and long exposures is validated.

A challenge for this technique is to control systematic errors that occur when measuring the shapes of distant galaxies. In this paper we investigate noise bias, a systematic error that arises from second order noise terms in the shape measurement process. We ﬁrst derive analytical expressions for the bias of general Maximum Likelihood estimators (MLEs) in the presence of additive noise. We then ﬁnd analytical expressions for a simpliﬁed toy model in which galaxies are modeled and ﬁtted with a Gaussian with its size as a single free parameter. Even for this very simple case we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant e↵ect. We also extend our analysis to a more realistic 6-parameter elliptical Gaussian model. We ﬁnd that the noise bias is generically of the order of the inverse-squared signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the galaxies and is thus of the order of a percent for galaxies of SNR of 10, i.e. comparable to the weak lensing shear signal. This is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than the systematics requirements for future all-sky weak lensing surveys. We discuss possible ways to circumvent this e↵ect, including a calibration method using simulations discussed in an associated paper.},

	abstract = {The weak-lensing science of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project drives the need to carefully model and separate the instrumental artifacts from the intrinsic shear signal caused by gravitational lensing. The dominant source of the systematics for all ground-based telescopes is the spatial correlation of the point-spread function (PSF) modulated by both atmospheric turbulence and optical aberrations in the telescope and camera system. In this article, we present a full field-of-view simulation of the LSST images by modeling both the atmosphere and the system optics with the most current data for the telescope and camera specifications and the environment. To simulate the effects of atmospheric turbulence, we generated six-layer Kolmogorov/von Kármán phase screens with the parameters estimated from the on-site measurements. LSST will continuously sample the wavefront, correcting the optics alignment and focus. For the optics, we combined the ray-tracing tool ZEMAX and our simulated focal-plane data to introduce realistic residual aberrations and focal-plane height variations. Although this expected focal-plane flatness deviation for LSST is small compared with that of other existing cameras, the fast focal ratio of the LSST optics cause this focal-plane flatness variation and the resulting PSF discontinuities across the CCD boundaries to be significant challenges in our removal of the PSF-induced systematics. We resolve this complication by performing principal component analysis (PCA) CCD by CCD and by interpolating the basis functions derived from the analysis using conventional polynomials. We demonstrate that this PSF correction scheme reduces the residual PSF ellipticity correlation below 10À7 over the cosmologically interesting (dark-matter-dominated) scale 100–3°. From a null test using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Ultra Deep Field (UDF) galaxy images without input shear, we verify that the amplitude of the galaxy ellipticity correlation function, after the PSF correction, is consistent with the shot noise set by the finite number of objects. We conclude that the current optical design and specification for the accuracy in the focal-plane assembly are sufficient to enable the control of the PSF systematics required for weak-lensing science with LSST.},

	abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model- independent estimator.Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25\% gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15\% improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ and dark energy \${\textbackslash}Omega\_{\textbackslash}Lambda\$ in an open \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},

	abstract = {Current and future imaging surveys will measure cosmic shear with statistical precision that demands a deeper understanding of potential systematic biases in galaxy shape measurements than has been achieved to date. We use analytic and computational techniques to study the impact on shape measurements of two atmospheric chromatic effects for ground-based surveys such as the Dark Energy Survey and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST): (1) atmospheric differential chromatic refraction and (2) wavelength dependence of seeing. We investigate the effects of using the point-spread function (PSF) measured with stars to determine the shapes of galaxies that have different spectral energy distributions than the stars. We ﬁnd that both chromatic effects lead to signiﬁcant biases in galaxy shape measurements for current and future surveys, if not corrected. Using simulated galaxy images, we ﬁnd a form of chromatic “model bias” that arises when ﬁtting a galaxy image with a model that has been convolved with a stellar, instead of galactic, PSF. We show that both forms of atmospheric chromatic biases can be predicted (and corrected) with minimal model bias by applying an ordered set of perturbative PSFlevel corrections based on machine-learning techniques applied to six-band photometry. Catalog-level corrections do not address the model bias. We conclude that achieving the ultimate precision for weak lensing from current and future ground-based imaging surveys requires a detailed understanding of the wavelength dependence of the PSF from the atmosphere, and from other sources such as optics and sensors.

	abstract = {Methods. We characterise the error made in the shear arising from errors on the PSF. We consider diﬀerent PSF models, from a simple elliptical Gaussian to various shapelet parametrisations. First we derive our results analytically in the case of inﬁnitely small pixels (i.e. inﬁnitely high resolution), then image simulations are used to validate these results and investigate the eﬀect of ﬁnite pixel size in the case of the elliptical Gaussian PSF.
Results. Our results are expressed in terms of the minimum number of stars required to calibrate the PSF in order to ensure that systematic errors are smaller than statistical errors when estimating the cosmological parameters. On scales smaller than the area containing this minimum number of stars, there is not enough information to model the PSF. This means that these small scales should not be used to constrain cosmology unless the instrument and the observing strategy are optimised to make this variability extremely small. The minimum number of stars varies with the square of the star Signal-to-Noise Ratio, with the complexity of thisdepend onwhatyo knowdI on'tkn the PSF and with at half maximum the pixel size. In the case (FWHM) implies a 20\% of an elliptical Gaussian PSF and in the absence of dithering, 2 pixels increase of the minimum number of stars compared to the ideal case per PSF full of inﬁnitely width small aboutspatial PsEscales pixels; 0.9 pixels per PSF FWHM implies a factor 100 increase.
Conclusions. In the case of a good resolution and a typical Signal-to-Noise Ratio distribution of stars, we ﬁnd that current surveys need the PSF to be calibrated over a few stars, which may explain residual systematics on scales smaller than a few arcmins. Future all-sky cosmic shear surveys require the PSF to be calibrated over a region containing about 50 stars. Due to the simplicity of our models these results should be interpreted as optimistic and therefore provide a measure of a systematic “ﬂoor’ intrinsic to shape measurements.},

	abstract = {In weak gravitational lensing, weighted quadrupole moments of the brightness proﬁle in galaxy images are a common way to estimate gravitational shear. We employ general adaptive moments (GLAM ) to study causes of shear bias on a fundamental level and for a practical deﬁnition of an image ellipticity. The GLAM ellipticity has useful properties for any chosen weight proﬁle: the weighted ellipticity is identical to that of isophotes of elliptical images, and in absence of noise and pixellation it is always an unbiased estimator of reduced shear. We show that moment-based techniques, adaptive or unweighted, are similar to a model-based approach in the sense that they can be seen as imperfect ﬁt of an elliptical proﬁle to the image. Due to residuals in the ﬁt, moment-based estimates of ellipticities are prone to underﬁtting bias when inferred from observed images. The estimation is fundamentally limited mainly by pixellation which destroys information on the original, pre-seeing image. We give an optimized estimator for the preseeing GLAM ellipticity and quantify its bias for noise-free images. To deal with images where pixel noise is prominent, we consider a Bayesian approach to infer GLAM ellipticity where, similar to the noise-free case, the ellipticity posterior can be inconsistent with the true ellipticity if we do not properly account for our ignorance about ﬁt residuals. This underﬁtting bias, quantiﬁed in the paper, does not vary with the overall noise level but changes with the pre-seeing brightness proﬁle and the correlation or heterogeneity of pixel noise over the image. Furthermore, when inferring a constant ellipticity or, more relevantly, constant shear from a source sample with a distribution of intrinsic properties (sizes, centroid positions, intrinsic shapes), an additional, now noise-dependent bias arises towards low signal-to-noise if incorrect prior densities for the intrinsic properties are used. We discuss the origin of this prior bias. With regard to a fully-Bayesian lensing analysis, we point out that passing tests with source samples subject to constant shear may not be suﬃcient for an analysis of sources with varying shear.},

This paper presents qp, a Python package for manipulating parametrizations of 1-dimensional PDFs, as suitable for photo-z PDF compression. We use qp to investigate the performance of three simple PDF storage formats (quantiles, samples, and step functions) as a function of the number of stored parameters on two realistic mock datasets, representative of upcoming surveys with di↵erent data qualities. We propose some best practices for choosing a photo-z PDF approximation scheme and demonstrate the approach on a science case using performance metrics on both ensembles of individual photo-z PDFs and an estimator of the overall redshift distribution function. We show that both the properties of the set of PDFs we wish to approximate and the ﬁdelity metric(s) chosen a↵ect the optimal parametrization. Additionally, we ﬁnd that quantiles and samples outperform step functions, and we encourage further consideration of these formats for PDF approximation.},

From the color dependence of the PSF, we fit a model between the monochromatic PSF trace radius, \$R\$, and wavelength of the form \$R({\textbackslash}lambda){\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}lambda{\textasciicircum}\{b\}\$. We find values of \$b\$ between -0.2 and -0.5, depending on the epoch and filter. This is consistent with the expectations of a turbulent atmosphere with an outer scale length of \${\textbackslash}sim 10-100\$ m, indicating that the atmosphere is dominating the chromaticity. We find evidence in the best seeing data that the optical system and detector also contribute some wavelength dependence. Meyers and Burchat (2015) showed that \$b\$ must be measured to an accuracy of \${\textbackslash}sim 0.02\$ not to dominate the systematic error budget of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) weak lensing (WL) survey. Using simple image simulations, we find that \$b\$ can be inferred with this accuracy in the \$r\$ and \$i\$-bands for all positions in the LSST field of view, assuming a stellar density of 1 star arcmin\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and that the optical PSF can be accurately modeled. Therefore, it is possible to correct for most, if not all, of the bias that the wavelength-dependent PSF will introduce into an LSST-like WL survey.},

This survey combined the Slope-Detection and Ranging (SLODAR) and Low-Layer SCIntillation Detection And Ranging (SCIDAR) (LOLAS) instruments into a single manually operated instrument capable of measuring the integrated seeing and the optical turbulence proﬁle within the ﬁrst kilometre with spatial and temporal resolutions of 40–80 m and 1 min (SLODAR) or 10–20 m and 5 min (LOLAS). The campaign began in the fall of 2006 and observed for roughly 50–60 h per month. The optical turbulence within the boundary layer is found to be conﬁned within an extremely thin layer (≤80 m), and the optical turbulence arising within the region from 80 to 650 m is normally very weak. Exponential ﬁts to the SLODAR proﬁles give an upper limit on the exponential scaleheight of between 25 and 40 m. The thickness of this layer shows a dependence on the turbulence strength near the ground, and under median conditions the scaleheight is {\textless}28 m. The LOLAS proﬁles show a multiplicity of layers very close to the ground but all within the ﬁrst 40 m. The free-atmosphere seeing measured by the SLODAR is 0.42 arcsec (median) at 0.5 µm and is, importantly, signiﬁcantly better than the typical delivered image quality at the larger telescopes on the mountain. This suggests that the current suite of telescopes on Mauna Kea is largely dominated by a very local seeing either from internal seeing, seeing induced by the ﬂow in/around the enclosures, or from an atmospheric layer very close to the ground. The results from our campaign suggest that groundlayer adaptive optics can be very effective in correcting this turbulence and, in principle, can provide very large corrected ﬁelds of view on Mauna Kea.},

The vertical proﬁle of the ground layer of turbulence is very varied, but in the median case most of the turbulence strength in the ground layer is concentrated within the ﬁrst 50 m altitude, with relatively weak turbulence at higher altitudes up to 500 m.

The SLODAR data suggest that a median improvement in the seeing angle from 0.689 to 0.481 arcsec at wavelength 500 nm would be obtained by fully correcting the ground-layer turbulence between the height of the UTs (taken as 10 m) and altitude 500 m.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the Earth’s atmospheric optical turbulence is critical for astronomical instrumentation. Not only does it enable performance veriﬁcation and optimization of the existing systems, but it is required for the design of future instruments. As a minimum this includes integrated astro-atmospheric parameters such as seeing, coherence time, and isoplanatic angle, but for more sophisticated systems such as wide-ﬁeld adaptive optics enabled instrumentation the vertical structure of the turbulence is also required. Stereo-SCIDAR (Scintillation Detection and Ranging) is a technique speciﬁcally designed to characterize the Earth’s atmospheric turbulence with high-altitude resolution and high sensitivity. Together with ESO (European Southern Observatory), Durham University has commissioned a Stereo-SCIDAR instrument at Cerro Paranal, Chile, the site of the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and only 20 km from the site of the future Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). Here we provide results from the ﬁrst 18 months of operation at ESO Paranal including instrument comparisons and atmospheric statistics. Based on a sample of 83 nights spread over 22 months covering all seasons, we ﬁnd the median seeing to be 0.64 with 50 per cent of the turbulence conﬁned to an altitude below 2 km and 40 per cent below 600 m. The median coherence time and isoplanatic angle are found as 4.18 ms and 1.75 , respectively. A substantial campaign of inter-instrument comparison was also undertaken to assure the validity of the data. The Stereo-SCIDAR proﬁles (optical turbulence strength and velocity as a function of altitude) have been compared with the Surface-Layer Slope Detection And Ranging, Multi-Aperture Scintillation Sensor-Differential Image Motion Monitor, and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts model. The correlation coefﬁcients are between 0.61 (isoplanatic angle) and 0.84 (seeing).},

	abstract = {The next generation of adaptive optics (AO) systems will require tomographic reconstruction techniques to map the optical refractive index ﬂuctuations, generated by the atmospheric turbulence, along the line of sight to the astronomical target. These systems can be enhanced with data from an external atmospheric proﬁler. This is important for Extremely Large Telescope scale tomography. Here we propose a new instrument which utilises the generalised SCIntillation Detection And Ranging (SCIDAR) technique to allow high sensitivity vertical proﬁles of the atmospheric optical turbulence and wind velocity proﬁle above astronomical observatories. The new approach, which we refer to as ‘Stereo–SCIDAR’, uses a stereoscopic system with the scintillation pattern from each star of a double-star target incident on a separate detector. Separating the pupil images for each star has several advantages including: increased magnitude diﬀerence tolerance for the target stars; negating the need for re-calibration due to the normalisation errors usually associated with SCIDAR; an increase of at least a factor of two in the signal-to-noise ratio of the cross–covariance function and hence the proﬁle for equal magnitude target stars and up to a factor of 16 improvement for targets of 3 magnitudes diﬀerence; and easier real-time reconstruction of the wind-velocity proﬁle. Theoretical response functions are calculated for the instrument, and the performance is investigated using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The technique is demonstrated using data recorded at the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope and the 1.0 m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope, both on La Palma.},

The constructed model is then rescaled with a factor to compensate for the contribution from a disk. We compare NMF with existing methods (classical reference di↵erential imaging method, and the Karhunen-Lo`eve image projection algorithm) using synthetic circumstellar disks, and demonstrate the superiority of NMF: with no need for prior selection of references, NMF can detect fainter circumstellar disks, better preserve low order disk morphology, and does not require forward modeling. As an application to a well-known disk example, we process the archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) STIS coronagraphic observations of HD 181327 with di↵erent methods and compare them. NMF is able to extract some circumstellar material inside the primary ring for the ﬁrst time.

Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of speci®c applications. However, in any speci®c application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the speci®c context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of ®tting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc ®tting, and after calibration the model is used, with the ®tted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the ®tted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-®tting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

	abstract = {We investigate the ellipticity of the point-spread function (PSF) produced by imaging an unresolved source with a telescope, subject to the effects of atmospheric turbulence. It is important to quantify these effects in order to understand the errors in shape measurements of astronomical objects, such as those used to study weak gravitational lensing of field galaxies. The PSF modeling involves either a Fourier transform of the phase information in the pupil plane or a ray-tracing approach, which has the advantage of requiring fewer computations than the Fourier transform. Using a standard method, involving the Gaussian weighted second moments of intensity, we then calculate the ellipticity of the PSF patterns. We find significant ellipticity for the instantaneous patterns (up to more than 10\%). Longer exposures, which we approximate by combining multiple (N) images from uncorrelated atmospheric realizations, yield progressively lower ellipticity (as 1 / sqrt(N)). We also verify that the measured ellipticity does not depend on the sampling interval in the pupil plane using the Fourier method. However, we find that the results using the ray-tracing technique do depend on the pupil sampling interval, representing a gradual breakdown of the geometric approximation at high spatial frequencies. Therefore, ray tracing is generally not an accurate method of modeling PSF ellipticity induced by atmospheric turbulence unless some additional procedure is implemented to correctly account for the effects of high spatial frequency aberrations. The Fourier method, however, can be used directly to accurately model PSF ellipticity, which can give insights into errors in the statistics of field galaxy shapes used in studies of weak gravitational lensing.},

Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n = 251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments. Our results highlight how understanding the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in STEM requires examining both racial and gender biases as well as how they intersect.},

This paper presents a generic version of the Feature-Based scheduler, with minimal manual tailoring, to demonstrate its potential and ﬂexibility as a foundation for large ground-based telescope schedulers which can later be adjusted for other instruments.

	abstract = {We use SDSS imaging data in \$ugriz\$ passbands to study the shape of the point spread function (PSF) profile and the variation of its width with wavelength and time. We find that the PSF profile is well described by theoretical predictions based on von K{\textbackslash}'\{a\}rm{\textbackslash}'\{a\}n's turbulence theory. The observed PSF radial profile can be parametrized by only two parameters, the profile's full width at half maximum (FWHM) and a normalization of the contribution of an empirically determined "instrumental" PSF. The profile shape is very similar to the "double gaussian plus power-law wing" decomposition used by SDSS image processing pipeline, but here it is successfully modeled with two free model parameters, rather than six as in SDSS pipeline. The FWHM variation with wavelength follows the \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$ power law, where \${\textbackslash}alpha {\textbackslash}approx-0.3\$ and is correlated with the FWHM itself. The observed behavior is much better described by von K{\textbackslash}'\{a\}rm{\textbackslash}'\{a\}n's turbulence theory with the outer scale parameter in the range 5\$-\$100 m, than by the Kolmogorov's turbulence theory. We also measure the temporal and angular structure functions for FWHM and compare them to simulations and results from literature. The angular structure function saturates at scales beyond 0.5\$-\$1.0 degree. The power spectrum of the temporal behavior is found to be broadly consistent with a damped random walk model with characteristic timescale in the range \${\textbackslash}sim5-30\$ minutes, though data show a shallower high-frequency behavior. The latter is well fit by a single power law with index in the range \$-1.5\$ to \$-1.0\$. A hybrid model is likely needed to fully capture both the low-frequency and high-frequency behavior of the temporal variations of atmospheric seeing.},

	abstract = {A semi analytic framework for simulating the eﬀects of atmospheric seeing in Adaptive Optics systems on an 8-m telescope is developed with the intention of understanding the origin of the wind-butterﬂy, a characteristic twolobed halo in the PSF of AO imaging. Simulations show that errors in the compensated phase on the aperture due to servo-lag have preferential direction orthogonal to the direction of wind propagation which, when Fourier Transformed into the image plane, appear with their characteristic lemniscate shape along the wind direction. We develop a metric to quantify the eﬀect of this aberration with the fractional standard deviation in an annulus centered around the PSF, and use telescope pointing to correlate this eﬀect with data from an atmospheric models, the NOAA GFS. Our results show that the jet stream at altitudes of 100-200 hPa (equivalently 10-15 km above sea level) is highly correlated (13.2 ) with the strong butterﬂy, while the ground wind and other layers are more or less uncorrelated.},
